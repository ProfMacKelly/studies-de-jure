Royer (1983) 460 U.S. 491, 499(plurality decision)\[“Normaythepolice seek to verify their suspicions by means that approach the conditions of arrest.”].However, as we discuss later, even if officers handcuffed the suspect or detained him at gunpoint (both quintessential indications of an arrest), a de facto arrest will not result if the precaution was reasonably necessary.
