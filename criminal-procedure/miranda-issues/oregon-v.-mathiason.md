# Oregon v. Mathiason

Supreme Court of the United States

**Oregon**&#x20;

**v.**&#x20;

**Carl Ray Mathiason**

[429 U.S. 492](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/429/492/) (1977)

### _**PER CURIAM.**_

Respondent Carl Mathiason was convicted of first-degree burglary after a bench trial in which his confession was critical to the State’s case. At trial he moved to suppress the confession as the fruit of questioning by the police not preceded by the warnings required in _Miranda v. Arizona_. The trial court refused to exclude the confession because it found that Mathiason was not in custody at the time of the confession.

The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed respondent’s conviction, but on his petition for review in the Supreme Court of Oregon that court by a divided vote reversed the conviction. It found that although Mathiason had not been arrested or otherwise formally detained, “the interrogation took place in a ‘coercive environment’” of the sort to which _Miranda_ was intended to apply. The State of Oregon has petitioned for certiorari to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oregon. We think that court has read Miranda too broadly, and we therefore reverse its judgment.

The Supreme Court of Oregon described the factual situation surrounding the confession as follows:

“An officer of the State Police investigated a theft at a residence near Pendleton. He asked the lady of the house which had been burglarized if she suspected anyone. She replied that the defendant was the only one she could think of. The defendant was a parolee and a ‘close associate’ of her son. The officer tried to contact defendant on three or four occasions with no success. Finally, about 25 days after the burglary, the officer left his card at defendant’s apartment with a note asking him to call because ‘I’d like to discuss something with you.’ The next afternoon the defendant did call. The officer asked where it would be convenient to meet. The defendant had no preference; so the officer asked if the defendant could meet him at the state patrol office in about an hour and a half, about 5:00 p.m. The patrol office was about two blocks from defendant’s apartment. The building housed several state agencies.”

“The officer met defendant in the hallway, shook hands and took him into an office. The defendant was told he was not under arrest. The door was closed. The two sat across a desk. The police radio in another room could be heard. The officer told defendant he wanted to talk to him about a burglary and that his truthfulness would possibly be considered by the district attorney or judge. The officer further advised that the police believed defendant was involved in the burglary and (falsely stated that) defendant’s fingerprints were found at the scene. The defendant sat for a few minutes and then said he had taken the property. This occurred within five minutes after defendant had come to the office. The officer then advised defendant of his _Miranda_ rights and took a taped confession.”

“At the end of the taped conversation the officer told defendant he was not arresting him at this time; he was released to go about his job and return to his family. The officer said he was referring the case to the district attorney for him to determine whether criminal charges would be brought. It was 5:30 p.m. when the defendant left the office.”

“The officer gave all the testimony relevant to this issue. The defendant did not take the stand either at the hearing on the motion to suppress or at the trial.”

Our decision in _Miranda_ set forth rules of police procedure applicable to “custodial interrogation.” “By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.” Subsequently we have found the _Miranda_ principle applicable to questioning which takes place in a prison setting during a suspect’s term of imprisonment on a separate offense, and to questioning taking place in a suspect’s home, after he has been arrested and is no longer free to go where he pleases.

In the present case, however, there is no indication that the questioning took place in a context where respondent’s freedom to depart was restricted in any way. He came voluntarily to the police station, where he was immediately informed that he was not under arrest. At the close of a ½-hour interview respondent did in fact leave the police station without hindrance. It is clear from these facts that Mathiason was not in custody “or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.”

Such a noncustodial situation is not converted to one in which _Miranda_ applies simply because a reviewing court concludes that, even in the absence of any formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement, the questioning took place in a “coercive environment.” Any interview of one suspected of a crime by a police officer will have coercive aspects to it, simply by virtue of the fact that the police officer is part of a law enforcement system which may ultimately cause the suspect to be charged with a crime. But police officers are not required to administer _Miranda_ warnings to everyone whom they question. Nor is the requirement of warnings to be imposed simply because the questioning takes place in the station house, or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect. _Miranda_ warnings are required only where there has been such a restriction on a person’s freedom as to render him “in custody.” It was that sort of coercive environment to which _Miranda_ by its terms was made applicable, and to which it is limited.

The officer’s false statement about having discovered Mathiason’s fingerprints at the scene was found by the Supreme Court of Oregon to be another circumstance contributing to the coercive environment which makes the _Miranda_ rationale applicable. Whatever relevance this fact may have to other issues in the case, it has nothing to do with whether respondent was in custody for purposes of the _Miranda_ rule.

The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

### **Mr. Justice MARSHALL, dissenting.**

The respondent in this case was interrogated behind closed doors at police headquarters in connection with a burglary investigation. He had been named by the victim of the burglary as a suspect, and was told by the police that they believed he was involved. He was falsely informed that his fingerprints had been found at the scene, and in effect was advised that by cooperating with the police he could help himself. Not until after he had confessed was he given the warnings set forth in _Miranda v. Arizona_.

The Court today holds that for constitutional purposes all this is irrelevant because respondent had not “‘been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.’” I do not believe that such a determination is possible on the record before us. It is true that respondent was not formally placed under arrest, but surely formalities alone cannot control. At the very least, if respondent entertained an objectively reasonable belief that he was not free to leave during the questioning, then he was “deprived of his freedom of action in a significant way.” Plainly the respondent could have so believed, after being told by the police that they thought he was involved in a burglary and that his fingerprints had been found at the scene. Yet the majority is content to note that “there is no indication that … respondent’s freedom to depart was restricted in any way,” as if a silent record (and no state-court findings) means that the State has sustained its burden of demonstrating that respondent received his constitutional due.

More fundamentally, however, I cannot agree with the Court’s conclusion that if respondent were not in custody no warnings were required. I recognize that _Miranda_ is limited to custodial interrogations, but that is because \[] the facts in the _Miranda_ cases raised only this “narrow issue.”

In my view, even if respondent were not in custody, the coercive elements in the instant case were so pervasive as to require _Miranda_-type warnings. Respondent was interrogated in “privacy” and in “unfamiliar surroundings,” factors on which _Miranda_ places great stress. The investigation had focused on respondent. And respondent was subjected to some of the “deceptive stratagems,” which called forth the _Miranda_ decision. I therefore agree with the Oregon Supreme Court that to excuse the absence of warnings given these facts is “contrary to the rationale expressed in _Miranda_.”

The privilege against self-incrimination “has always been ‘as broad as the mischief against which it seeks to guard.’” Today’s decision means, however, that the Fifth Amendment privilege does not provide full protection against mischiefs equivalent to, but different from, custodial interrogation. I respectfully dissent.
