      <h2>Definition, Function, and Content</h2>
      <p>The criminal complaint is a written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. It functions as a pleading, which acts to confer both subject matter and personal jurisdiction upon the court. <br /><br />A complaint that charges no offense known to the law deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction. It is void, and the defect cannot be waived by a guilty plea. A&nbsp;complaint that charges an offense unknown to the law is one that omits an essential element of the crime charged, as defined by statute or case law. <br /><br />In terms of personal jurisdiction, the complaint must set forth probable cause; that is, it must set forth facts that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that a crime had probably been committed and that the defendant named in the complaint was probably the culpable party.&nbsp;A complaint that sufficiently alleges probable cause confers personal jurisdiction over the defendant; a defective complaint deprives the trial court of personal jurisdiction.<br /><br />The criminal complaint also serves a constitutional notice function to the defendant in that it informs the defendant of the nature and cause of the accusations against him or her, as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Art. I, § 7 of the Wisconsin Constitution. The test of its constitutional sufficiency in this regard is twofold:
      <ol>
        <li>whether the accusation is such that the defendant can determine whether it states an offense to which s/he is able to plead and prepare a defense,&nbsp;</li>
        <li>whether conviction or acquittal is a bar to another prosecution for the same offense.</li>
      </ol>
      Since the complaint is thus informative and not adjudicative,9 however, it need not establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a rea-sonable doubt.10
