# 1.3.2 Sources & Classifications of Law

There are several types of laws that impact professionals, government agencies, and businesses with bioethical obligations. [**Laws** ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/law)are rules that govern the conduct of individuals, communities, and private and public entities. Laws are created, administered, and enforced by government authorities, such as courts and administrative agencies (including professional licensing and ethics boards). Every person is responsible for being aware of the public and private laws that affect their personal and professional conduct, as well as the types of legal actions that can result when these laws are broken or others' legally protected rights and interests are violated.

In the broadest sense, laws are generally classified as public or private law. **Public law** regulates the relationship between [people ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]and the government, whereas **private law** governs the relationships between private parties.

## Public Law

There are several types of public law, including constitutional, statutory, administrative, and criminal law.

**Constitutional law** refers to the rights, privileges, and responsibilities established by the U.S. Constitution or a state constitution.\[1] The right to privacy is an example of a person's right based on constitutional law.

**Statutory law** refers to written laws enacted by the federal or state legislature. For example, the [Nurse Practice Act](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] in each state is an example of statute enacted by that state’s legislature. The [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-104publ191/pdf/PLAW-104publ191.pdf) (HIPAA) is an example of a federal statutory law. HIPAA required the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without consent or knowledge. (Learn more about HIPAA [**here**](https://www.hhs.gov/programs/hipaa/index.html).)

**Administrative law** refers to laws created by government agencies.\[2] At the federal level, for example, the [Occupational Safety and Health Administration](https://www.osha.gov/) (OSHA) makes regulations governing safety and effects on health in work environments. For instance, this is OSHA's [personal protective equipment (PPE)](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.132) regulation.

A state administrative law example includes regulations issued by a state's Board of Nursing (SBON). For instance, [Wisconsin's Board of Nursing](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/441) issued and administers a [series of regulations](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/n/2.pdf) that govern several topics, such as standards of [professional ethical rules](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/n/7.pdf), [licensing](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/n/2.pdf), and [prescribing privileges](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/n/8.pdf).

**Criminal law** is a system of laws concerned with the punishment of individuals who commit crimes.\[3] A **crime** is a prohibited action defined by Congress or a state's legislature as deserving of punishment. Crimes are classified as felonies, misdemeanors, and infractions.

In all federal and state courts, two fundamental standards must be satisfied to convict someone of a crime: First, every defendant charged with a crime is [**presumed innocent**](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] until the evidence presented in a fair trial establishes their guilt. Second, the government must prove the defendant's guilt [**beyond a reasonable doubt**](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]. This means that the evidence must weigh so heavily in favor of guilt (as opposed to innocence) that any doubt of the defendant's guilt is unreasonable. In other words, without any mere speculation or guesswork, a fair and rational consideration of the evidence—or lack of evidence—leaves no reasonable explanation other than guilt.

<figure><img src="https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/37/2021/08/Courtroom-Trial-with-Judge-Jury-Vector-Image.jpg" alt="Image depicting an attorney making an argument to a jury" height="351" width="624"><figcaption><p>An attorney making an argument to a jury [4]</p></figcaption></figure>

Serious crimes that can result in imprisonment for longer than one year are called **felonies**. Felony convictions can also result in the loss of voting rights, the ability to own or use guns, and the loss of one’s nursing license. An example of a felony committed by some nurses is drug diversion of controlled substances.

**Misdemeanors** are less serious crimes resulting in penalties of fines and/or imprisonment for less than one year. For example, in Wisconsin, misdemeanors are categorized as Class A, B, or C based on their sentencing. Class A misdemeanors are sentenced to a fine not to exceed $10,000 or imprisonment not to exceed nine months, or both. Class B misdemeanors are sentenced to a fine not to exceed $1,000 or imprisonment not to exceed 90 days, or both. Class C misdemeanors are sentenced to a fine not to exceed $500 or imprisonment not to exceed 30 days, or both.\[5] Examples of misdemeanors include battery, possession of controlled substances, petty theft, disorderly conduct, and driving under the influence (DUI) charges. Although considered less serious crimes, misdemeanors can impact an individual’s ability to obtain or maintain licenses to practice their profession.

{% hint style="info" %}
Many professionals must self-report their criminal convictions to their state government. For example, in Wisconsin, anyone working in a [profession or occupation subject to licensing or other required credentialing](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/440.03\(13\)\(am\)) must self-report a conviction to the state Department of Safety and Professional Services within 48 hours of a court's entry of the judgment of conviction.
{% endhint %}

**Infractions** are minor offenses, such as speeding tickets, resulting in fines but not jail time. Infractions do not generally impact nursing licensure unless there is a significant quantity of them over a short period of time.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Sample Case**\
An LPN working for a hospice agency was accused of stealing a client’s pain medications and substituting them with anti-seizure medication. The family asserted the actions of the LPN prolonged the client’s suffering. The LPN served time in prison for diverting the client’s medications.\[6]
{% endhint %}

## Private/Civil Law

Private law, which refers to legal rules governing non-criminal conduct, predominantly focuses on the rights, responsibilities, and legal relationships between private citizens. In the United States, this is commonly referred to as [**civil law**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_law).

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:red;">Terminology: "Civil Law" versus "Civil Law"</mark></summary>

"Civil law" is a term that has two uses: In the United States, "civil law" refers to a _classification of law in the United States_. In much of Europe and South America (see the map below), "civil law" refers to a _legal system_, which relies on comprehensive legal codes that contains all laws for the country.

As noted in [Section 1.2.1](1.3.1-the-dual-court-system.md), unlike civil law systems, the United States is a [common law system](https://prof-mackelly.gitbook.io/bioethics-and-the-law/unit-1-introduction-1/1.2-brief-introduction-to-the-law-and-the-american-legal-system/1.2.1-the-dual-court-system#what-is-a-common-law-legal-system), which has British origins.

</details>

The consequences of infringing on others' legal rights and interests typically involve compensation to an injured party (which may include physical, mental, and economic harm). Unlike criminal law, which requires the government to prove that someone is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, most proceedings in the civil law context require the plaintiff to establish that the defendant is at fault[^5] by a **preponderance of the evidence**. In other words, the evidence supporting the plaintiff's claims outweighs the evidence supporting the defendant's claims.\[7] (Another explanation is **preponderance of the evidence** is that the evidence demonstrates that the plaintiff's claims are "[more likely true than not true](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/preponderance_of_the_evidence).")

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/scales.png" alt="Image showing preponderance of the evidence with one side of the scale with 51% of the weight and the other side with 49% of the weight" width="256"><figcaption><p>Preponderance of the Evidence [8]</p></figcaption></figure>

Civil law affects every person's actions, whether personal or professional. Among many other areas of law, civil law includes **contract law** and **tort law**. **Contracts** are legally enforceable written, verbal, or implied agreements. A **tort** is an act of **commission** (i.e., doing something) or **omission** (i.e., failing to do something) that wrongly causes injury to another person or entity. Tort law exists to compensate people for such injuries. In the context of torts, “injury” (also referred to as "harm") describes the invasion of any legal right or interest.\[9] Tort law exists to compensate people

There are two general categories of torts: intentional torts and unintentional torts.

### **Intentional Torts**

Someone commits an **intentional tort** when an action causes harm with either (a) the intent to cause harm or (b) the knowledge that harm is substantially certain to occur. Examples of intentional torts include assault, battery, false imprisonment, slander, libel, and invasion of privacy (including breaches of confidentiality).

### **Unintentional Torts**

Unintentional torts include the torts of **negligence** and **strict liability.** <mark style="background-color:orange;">occur when the defendant’s action causes harm with oor inactions are unreasonably unsafe. Unintentional torts can result from acts of</mark> <mark style="background-color:orange;">**commission**</mark> <mark style="background-color:orange;">(i.e., doing something a reasonable nurse would not have done) or</mark> <mark style="background-color:orange;">**omission**</mark> <mark style="background-color:orange;">(i.e., failing to do something a reasonable person in the defe</mark>ndant's shoes would do, such as a reasonable physician or reasonable nurse).\[10]

**Negligence** (such as malpractice) is an unintentional tort. Tort law exists to compensate people injured by negligent practices and other conduct, provide corrective judgment, and deter negligence with visible consequences of action or inaction.\[11,12] Examples of common torts affecting nursing practice are discussed in further detail in the following subsections.

### Examples of Torts

#### **Assault and Battery**

Assault and battery are intentional torts. **Assault** is defined as intentionally putting another person in reasonable apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact.\[13] **Battery** is defined as intentionally causing harmful or offensive contact with another person without that person’s consent.\[14] Physical harm does not need to occur to be charged with assault or battery. Battery convictions are often misdemeanors but can be felonies if serious bodily harm occurs. To avoid the risk of being charged with assault or battery, nurses must obtain consent from clients to provide hands-on care.

#### **False Imprisonment**

**False imprisonment** is an intentional tort. False imprisonment is defined as an act of restraining another person and causing that person to be confined in a bounded area.\[15] In nursing practice, for example, restraints can be physical, chemical, or verbal. Nurses must strictly follow agency policies related to the use of restraints. Physical restraints typically require a provider order and documentation according to strict guidelines within specific time frames.

<figure><img src="https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/37/2021/08/PinelRestaint-1024x496.jpg" alt="Photo showing simulated patient in restraints" width="375"><figcaption><p>Full Physical Medical Restraints [16]</p></figcaption></figure>

Chemical restraints include administering medications such as benzodiazepines and require clear documentation supporting their use. Verbal threats to keep an individual in an inpatient environment can also qualify as false imprisonment and should be avoided.

#### **Invasion of Privacy and Breaches Confidentiality**

Breaching privacy and confidentiality are intentional torts. **Confidentiality** is the right of an individual to have personal, identifiable medical information, referred to as protected health information (PHI), kept private. Protected Health Information (PHI) is defined as individually identifiable health information, including demographic data, that relates to the individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition\[17]; the provision of health care to the individual; and the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual.

This right is protected by federal regulations called the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://www.hhs.gov/programs/hipaa/index.html). HIPAA was enacted in 1996 and was prompted by the need to ensure privacy and protection of personal health records and data in an environment of electronic medical records and third-party insurance payers. There are two main sections of HIPAA law: the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule. The Privacy Rule addresses the use and disclosure of individuals’ health information. The Security Rule sets national standards for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronically protected health information. HIPAA regulations extend beyond medical records and apply to client information shared with others. Therefore, all types of client information should be shared only with healthcare team members who are actively providing care to them.\[18,19]

HIPAA violations may result in fines from $100 for an individual violation to $1.5 million for organizational violations. Criminal penalties, including jail time of up to ten years, may be imposed for violations involving the use of PHI for personal gain or malicious intent. Nursing students are also required to adhere to HIPAA guidelines from the moment they enter the clinical setting or risk being disciplined or expelled by their nursing program.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Sample Case**

An RN accessed a client’s medical records, as well as the records of the newborn son, although she was not assigned to their care because she believed the newborn was her biological grandchild. Although the chart was accessed for less than five seconds, it was unauthorized. The nurse was publicly reprimanded by the state’s Board of Nursing, and her multistate licensure privileges were revoked. Expenses to defend the nurse exceeded $2,800.\[20]
{% endhint %}

#### **Slander and Libel**

Slander and libel are intentional torts. **Defamation of character** occurs when an individual makes negative, malicious, and false remarks about another person to damage their reputation. **Slander** is spoken defamation and **libel** is written defamation. Nurses must take care to communicate and document facts regarding client care without defamation in their oral and written communications with clients and coworkers.

#### **Fraud**

**Fraud** is an intentional tort occurring when an individual is deceived for personal gain. An example of fraud is financial exploitation perpetrated by individuals who are in positions of trust.\[21,22] A nurse may be charged with fraud for documenting interventions not performed or altering documentation to cover up an error, which can result in one or more of the following: civil liability, criminal charges, and suspension or revocation of a nurse’s license.

#### **Negligence and Malpractice**

Negligence is a type of unintentional tort. **Negligence** is the failure to exercise the ordinary care a reasonable person would use in similar circumstances. In Wisconsin, someone fails to use "ordinary care and is negligent if the person, without intending to do harm, does something (or fails to do something) that a reasonable person would recognize as creating an unreasonable risk of injury or damage to a person or property.”\[23] [**Malpractice** ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/malpractice)is a specific term used for negligence committed by a professional with a license by failing to follow the standards generally accepted in their profession.

<figure><img src="https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/37/2021/08/malpractice-1024x683.jpg" alt="Image showing gavel and a sign reading malpractice" width="375"><figcaption><p>[24]</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Elements of Malpractice by Healthcare Professionals**

It is important to understand the elements required to prove malpractice. All the following elements must be established in a court of law to prove malpractice\[25]:

* [**Duty of Care**](1.3.2-sources-and-classifications-of-law.md#duty-of-care)**:** The healthcare practitioner had a professional relationship with someone (e.g., doctor-patient, nurse-patient/client, etc.), or the professional owed some other legal duty of care to someone.
* [**Breach of Duty**](1.3.2-sources-and-classifications-of-law.md#breach-of-duty)**:** The practitioner did not meet their duty of care (e.g., a medical standard of care), and harm was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the action or inaction.
* [**Causation** ](1.3.2-sources-and-classifications-of-law.md#cause)**of Harm:** The breach of duty caused [harm (referred to legally as damages)](1.3.2-sources-and-classifications-of-law.md#harm).
{% endhint %}

Parties bringing a lawsuit must be able to demonstrate their interests were harmed, providing a reason to stand before the court. The party bringing the lawsuit is called the **plaintiff**. The party accused of negligence in the lawsuit is called the **defendant**. Statistically, malpractice lawsuits name physicians or hospitals, although nurses can be individually named. Generally, employers can be held liable for the [actions of their employees](#user-content-fn-6)[^6], which is called [**vicarious liability**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/vicarious_liability).\[26]

Malpractice lawsuits are concerned with the legal obligations nurses have to their patients to adhere to current standards of practice. These legal obligations are referred to as the professional's **duty of reasonable care**. The concept of [**reasonable care**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/reasonable_care) refers to the degree of care a [**reasonably prudent person**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/reasonable_person) would exercise in the professional's circumstances. Professionals are required to adhere to their standards of practice when providing treatment or service. This includes following organizational policies and procedures, maintaining clinical competency, and confining their activities to the authorized scope of practice as defined by their state’s [Nurse Practice Act](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/441/). Professionals also have a legal duty to be physically, mentally, and morally fit for practice. When they do not meet these obligations, they have breached their duty of care.\[27]

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Duty of Care</mark>

In the work environment, a duty is created when the nurse accepts responsibility for a patient or client and establishes a nurse-patient relationship. This generally occurs during inpatient care upon acceptance of a handoff report from another nurse. Outside the work environment, a nurse-client relationship is created when the nurse volunteers services. Some states have statutes requiring notification of authorities (also referred to as mandatory reporting) or summoning assistance.\[28]

**Good Samaritan Law**

The **Good Samaritan Law** provides protections against negligence claims to individuals who render aid to people experiencing medical emergencies outside of clinical environments. All 50 states in the United States have a version of a Good Samaritan Law. See Figure 5.5\[29] for historical artwork depicting a Good Samaritan. Differences exist in state laws regarding protection of bystanders who provide aid. For example, in Wisconsin, the law states, “Any person who renders emergency care at the scene of any emergency or accident in good faith is immune from civil liability for the person’s acts or omissions in rendering such emergency care.”\[30] There are a few states that require some emergency bystander action, so nurses should review the law in states they are visiting. It is also important to keep in mind that although anyone can file a lawsuit against someone who provides bystander aid, the Good Samaritan laws typically negate any penalty to the person rendering aid.

Although the majority of Good Samaritan laws are at the state level, the federal Aviation Medical Assistance Act (AMAA) provides liability protection for aid given on aircraft. The most common in-flight medical emergencies involve syncope, as well as gastrointestinal, respiratory, and cardiac events.\[31] Note that consent for care by an unconscious person is implied, but consent must be obtained from alert individuals.

<figure><img src="https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/37/2021/08/The_good_samaritan_helping_a_stranger_who_has_been_ignored_b_Wellcome_V0015249-1024x894.jpg" alt="Image showing the Good Samaritan art work" height="499" width="571"><figcaption><p>Good Samaritan</p></figcaption></figure>

**Mandatory Reporting**

Nurses are legally responsible for reporting certain crimes. Mandatory reporting requirements vary based on the state of practice, but there are some commonalities. For example, nurses are mandated to report suspected abuse of children, the elderly, and the disabled (if they have been deemed as incompetent by a court of law or as incapacitated by qualified health care providers).

Nurses are also mandated to report gunshot wounds, dog bites, some communicable diseases, and unsafe or illegal practices of other healthcare team members. Reporting responsibility often begins at the organizational level. The nurse may also need to identify the appropriate local, state, or federal authorities to submit the report and pursue it to its resolution.

**Sample Statute Regarding Duty to Assist**

A Minnesota statute states that a person at the scene of an emergency who knows that another person is exposed to or has suffered grave physical harm shall, to the extent that the person can do so without danger or peril to self or others, give reasonable assistance to the exposed person. Reasonable assistance may include obtaining or attempting to obtain aid from law enforcement or medical personnel. A person who violates this is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.\[32]

**Implications for Nurses**

Duty can be established in many ways. Nurses have a duty of reasonable care for a client they have been assigned. They may also have a duty in other circumstances. Therefore, nurses should understand the following\[33]:

* Recognize that a nurse-client relationship is established upon acceptance of responsibility for a client, whether after a handoff report in the workplace or during volunteered services.
* Assume that on-call or supervisory responsibilities create a duty to clients, even in the absence of an expressed nurse-client relationship.
* Know if there is a duty to rescue statute in their state, and if so, what it demands.

#### Breach of Duty

The second element of malpractice is breach of duty. After a plaintiff has established the first element in a malpractice suit, that the nurse owed a duty to the plaintiff, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the nurse breached that duty by failing to comply with the duty of reasonable care.\[34]

To demonstrate that a nurse breached their duty to a client the plaintiff must prove the nurse departed from acceptable standards of practice. The plaintiff must establish how a reasonably prudent nurse in the same or similar circumstances would act and then show that the defendant nurse departed from that standard of practice. The plaintiff must claim the nurse did something a reasonably prudent nurse would not have done (an act of commission) or failed to do something a reasonable nurse would have done (an act of omission).\[35]

Experts are needed during court hearings to explain things outside the knowledge of non-nurse jurors. In reaching their opinions, experts review many materials, including the state’s Nurse Practice Act and organizational policies, to determine whether the nurse adhered to them. To qualify as a nurse expert, the person testifying must have relevant experience, education, skill, and knowledge. They typically have advanced degrees, are published in nursing literature, have spoken at professional conferences, and belong to professional organizations. Medical malpractice trials take place primarily in state courts, so experts are deemed qualified based on state requirements.

![Image showing drawing of gavel inside circle shape](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/37/2021/10/gavel-01-300x300.png)

**Sample Case Regarding Breach of Duty**\[36]

Mary Jones was an 87-year-old woman who presented to the hospital with dizziness, nausea, intermittent slurred speech, an unsteady gait, and a history of four falls at home that day. Significant medical history included heart disease and multiple medications. The admitting nurse assessed her as being at risk for falls and placed her on universal fall precautions. The fall precautions included keeping the bed in the lowest position, instructing her on the use of the call light and ensuring the call light was within her reach, providing a bedside commode, and placing her in a room close to the nurses’ station where she could be observed. However, the nurse did not use a formal scoring system for fall risk assessment that was set forth in a nursing procedures textbook. Additionally, bed alarms had not been working at this agency for a year.

Five days later, a nurse responded to a sound coming from Mrs. Jones’s room and found her lying on the bathroom floor. She was conscious and able to move all extremities but complained of left knee and elbow pain. The physician was notified, and Mrs. Jones was sent for X-rays and a CT scan. When Mrs. Jones returned to her room, the nurse observed she was diaphoretic and deteriorating. The nurse took Mrs. Jones to the emergency department, where she lost consciousness. She was evaluated by a neurosurgeon, intubated, and airlifted to a different hospital for a higher level of care. She never regained consciousness and died the next day from intracranial bleeding that was aggravated by anticoagulant therapy.

Mrs. Jones’s estate brought a lawsuit alleging nursing malpractice. The estate’s nursing expert stated the universal fall precautions had been inadequate for a high-risk client and additional measures should have been instituted. The expert testified that not only had the admitting nurse not adhered to the formal scoring system for fall risk assessment in the nursing procedures textbook, but also the standard of care required nurses to use bed alarms, institute 15-minute rounds, or place a sitter in the room.

A defense expert used The Joint Commission’s National Patient Safety Goals to define the standard of care and testified it was her opinion the nurse had met that standard. The organizational policy did not require bed alarms as part of its fall prevention plan. Although the nurses did not use the formal scoring system in a textbook to assess the client’s risk, they clearly identified her as being at risk for falling; assessed her frequently; maintained her bed in the lowest position; kept the wheels of her bed locked and her side rails up; and kept the call light within her reach. They instructed her on the use of the call light and placed her in a room where she could be readily observed.

The court entered the judgment for the defendant hospital, noting that “under the circumstances, it is a close call on whether the hospital, by not having functioning bed alarms and staff not checking on Mary more frequently, breached the standard of care.”\[37] In this case, the plaintiff’s expert had not demonstrated the standard of care was breached.

**Implications for Nurses**

Nurses defending themselves against allegations of professional malpractice must demonstrate their actions conformed with accepted standards of practice. They must convince a jury they acted as a reasonably prudent nurse would have in the same or similar circumstances. Nurses should always follow these practices\[38]:

* Adhere to organizational policies and procedures. Work-arounds can create liability. The standard of practice is to adhere to agency policy. Failing to do so creates an assumption of departure from standards.
* Document in a manner that permits accurate reconstruction of client assessments and the sequence of events, especially when notifying providers regarding clinical concerns.
* Maintain competence through continuing education, participation in professional conferences, membership in professional organizations, and subscriptions to professional journals.
* When using an interpreter, ensure that properly trained interpreters are used and document the name of the interpreter. The use of family, friends, or other untrained interpreters is unsafe practice and is not consistent with acceptable standards of practice.
* Maintain professional boundaries. Personal relationships with clients or their families can be red flags for juries and can be viewed as evidence of departure from professional standards.

#### Cause

The third element of malpractice is cause. After the plaintiff has established the nurse owed a duty to a client and then breached that duty, they must then demonstrate that damages or harm were caused by that breach. Plaintiffs cannot prevail by only demonstrating the nurse departed from acceptable standards of practice but must also prove that such departures were the cause of any injuries.\[39] Additionally, nurses are held accountable for foreseeability, meaning a nurse of ordinary skill, care, and diligence could anticipate the risk of harm of departing from standards of practice in similar circumstances.\[40]

Plaintiffs must be able to link the defendant’s acts or omissions to the harm for which they are seeking compensation. This requires expert testimony from a physician because it requires a medical diagnosis. Unlike in criminal cases, in which the standard of proof is that elements of prosecution must be proven “beyond reasonable doubt,” the elements of a malpractice lawsuit must be proven by a “preponderance of evidence.” Expert testimony is required to demonstrate “medical certainty” that the nurse’s breach was the cause of an actual injury.

![Image showing drawing of gavel inside circle shape](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/37/2021/10/gavel-01-300x300.png)

**Sample Cases Regarding Causation**

**Case 1**

Janusz Osiecki was admitted to a subacute nursing facility to recover from Guillain-Barre syndrome. The standard of nursing care for this client included respiratory assessments and tracheostomy care. One morning, three weeks into his stay, he was found unresponsive, without pulse or respirations. His wife brought a wrongful death lawsuit, and expert witnesses testified the nurses breached the standard of care in not performing respiratory and tracheostomy assessments every two hours. Their rationale was that the purpose of the assessments was to detect and report pulmonary congestion, and if the nurses had done so in a timely manner, Mr. Osiecki could have received medical care that would have saved his life. A jury awarded the widow $577,005 for wrongful death and $250,000 for harm to family relationships.\[41]

**Case 2**

A client identified as “C” was locked in a seclusion room after presenting to a hospital with psychosis and continuing bizarre behavior, hallucinations, irrationality, lack of contact with reality, and agitation. She was in the seclusion room undergoing treatment for over a week when she suffered a grand mal seizure. A psychiatrist ordered antipsychotic medication. The medication order was not noted by nursing staff until the next day, at which point it was discovered the medication was unavailable at the pharmacy. The psychiatrist was not made aware the medication was unavailable, and the client went without the prescribed medication for three days. The nurses also did not notify the psychiatrist during those three days that C was becoming increasingly more agitated and hallucinating. On the fourth day, C attempted to leave the unit and told staff she was hearing voices instructing her to harm herself. She was returned to seclusion and remained there without being assessed or treated. Four hours later, she was found unconscious with her head wedged between the side rail and the mattress. She suffered brain damage that left her in a permanent semicomatose state.

C’s estate brought a lawsuit alleging it was negligent to leave C in a steel bed in a seclusion room without constant observation. The jury awarded $3.6 million. The hospital appealed, but the appellate court upheld the jury verdict and explained that particular injuries do not need to be foreseen, only the general harm that can occur. The court stated, “It is not extraordinary that a psychotic client who is delusional…might wedge herself between a mattress and side rail in an attempt to hurt herself.”\[42]

**Implications for Nurses**

Nurses can reduce their liability by adhering to professional standards and documenting their observations and communications. Nurses should always follow these standards\[43]:

* Follow the chain of command when there are concerns about unclear or potentially unsafe orders. Pursue concerns to resolution, documenting precisely who is notified and at what times.
* Document observations to justify clinical decisions. Variance charting (i.e., only charting things that vary from the norm) does not provide sufficient evidence of compliance with the standards of care.
* Adhere to organizational policies and procedures with an understanding that a failure to do so creates foreseeable harm to clients.

#### Harm

The fourth element of malpractice is harm. In a civil lawsuit, after a plaintiff has established the nurse owed a duty to the client and breached that duty and injury was caused by the nurse’s breach, they must prove the injury resulted in damages. They request repayment for what they have lost.\[44]

There are several types of injuries for which clients or their representatives seek compensation. Injuries can be physical, emotional, financial, professional, marital, or any combination of these. Physical injuries include loss of function, disfigurement, physical or mental impairment, exacerbation of prior medical problems, the need for additional medical care, and death. Economic injuries can include lost wages, additional medical expenses, rehabilitation, durable medical expenses, the need for architectural changes to one’s home, the loss of earning capacity, the need to hire people to do things the plaintiff can no longer do, and the loss of financial support. Emotional injuries can include psychological damage, emotional distress, or other forms of mental suffering.\[45]

Determining the specific amount a plaintiff needs can require expert witness testimony from a person known as a life care planner who is trained in analyzing and evaluating medical costs, as well as the subjective determination of a jury. Damages fall into several categories, including compensatory (economic) damages, noneconomic damages, and punitive damages.\[46] See Figure 5.6\[47] for an illustration of damages.

**Economic damages** (also referred to as actual damages) can be quantified. They are intended to restore the plaintiff to the position they were in before being injured. Compensatory damages are objectively calculated to provide the plaintiff with the amount of money necessary to replace what was lost.\[48]

**Noneconomic damages** are subjective and can include things such as emotional distress, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, reputation damage, loss of companionship, or loss of parental guidance. They are more difficult to quantify than economic damages.\[49]

**Punitive damages** are awards not related to the actual injury but are intended to punish the defendant(s) and deter others from engaging in similar conduct. In professional malpractice cases, punitive damages are difficult for plaintiffs to obtain because they must be related to outrageous conduct, such as gross negligence, recklessness, willful actions, or fraud.\[50]

**Sample Case** **Related to Damages**\[51]

Betty Shiflett fell out of bed in the recovery room after undergoing knee surgery. Three days later, she reported a clicking sound and pain in her knee to one of the nurses. Although the nurse documented these symptoms, she did not convey the information to the physician. A physical therapist reported these symptoms to the physician a week later. The physician then identified a previously undiagnosed nondisplaced left tibial fracture that was now avulsed. Two additional surgeries were unsuccessful, and Betty remained disabled, confined to a wheelchair, and in chronic pain.

Betty and her husband filed a lawsuit alleging negligence for the fall and the nurse’s failure to report the symptoms to the physician. They also asserted a claim for a loss of consortium, meaning the spouse or family had also been harmed. The harm suffered is a loss of companionship, conjugal relations, support and services, or marital quality. The jury awarded total damages of $2,391,620 with the following breakdown:

* $791,620 for future medical expenses
* $800,000 for past noneconomic damages
* $500,000 for future noneconomic damages
* $300,000 for loss of consortium with spouse

#### Implications for Nurses

Nurses can reduce their liability exposure by following these principles\[52]:

* Practicing according to current standards of practice.
* Maintaining professional liability insurance to provide coverage for events and licensure defense.
* Avoiding workarounds or deviations from organizational policies and procedures.
* Maintaining clinical competency, including awareness of standard-of-practice changes.
* Engaging the chain of command with client concerns and pursuing concerns to resolution.
* Documenting in a manner that permits accurate reconstruction of client assessments, notification of others, and the sequence of events.
