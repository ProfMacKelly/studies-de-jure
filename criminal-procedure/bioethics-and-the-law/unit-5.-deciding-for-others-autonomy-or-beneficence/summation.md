# Summation

In this unit, you learned how our courts make a determination of a patient's competence, and how difficult that determination may be depending on the varying levels of impairment. You have also seen how courts have struggled with the issue of making decisions for a patient when the patient is unable to do so, and the different standards and tests used, as well as the weight given to decision-making authority.

Further, you have considered how decisions are made for patients at different stages in life, newborns and children who don't yet have competence, adults who formerly had competence, and the "never-competent" adult. Finally, you have studied cases that have demonstrated the difficult task courts are faced with when deciding how best to make a decision for an incompetent patient, whether to consider what the patient "would have wanted" under the circumstances or what is best for the patient despite any stated wishes.

In [the next](./) unit, you will confront the issue of the human body as an object of exchange and commodity.
