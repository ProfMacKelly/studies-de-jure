## Concordia University Wisconsin & Marquette University Law School 3+3 Pre-Law Partnership Program Requirements and Timeline

***

### Application Timing and Eligibility

Students may apply for entrance into the 3+3 program any time before the first semester of their sophomore begins. Late applicants may be eligible only after (1) the student consults with the Pre-Law advisor and the student's staff advisor, and (2) at their discretion, both advisors approve the student's participation.

### Program Completion Requirements and Conditions

{% hint style="info" %}
Completing the requirements below will make the student _eligible to apply_ for admission to Marquette University Law School(MULS) during their junior year. Satisfying these requirements _does not_ guarantee admission to law school.
{% endhint %}

Students will satisfy the following conditions by the conclusion of their junior year:

* [ ] Completion of curricular requirements
  * [ ] 91 or more total credits (i.e., of the overall 120 credits necessary for graduation eligibility, the student has no more than 29 credits remaining)
  * [ ] Requirements of the student's major
  * [ ] Requirements of the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum
* [ ] Completion of the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT)

Additional conditions:

* [ ] The student must meet all application and deposit deadlines of MULS.&#x20;
* [ ] The student's law school application must include a letter of certification from the CUW Registrar, stating the student meets the program requirements.
* [ ] In addition to other factors MULS evaluates when considering applicants for admission, the student shall be subject to a character and fitness examination by the MULS Admissions and Recruitment Committee.

### Program Withdrawal

Students who begin the program but decide not to apply to or attend MULS may withdraw from the program at any time.&#x20;



They are not required to apply to Marquette University.&#x20;

Students who have been accepted to Marquette University are not required to matriculate and may choose to remain at Concordia for their senior year.



Marquette will consider applicants from the program for all scholarships and financial aid on an equal basis with all other applicants to Marquette Law School. Students are considered graduate/professional students for purposes of financial aid.

Concordia 3+3 students who are not admitted to Marquette after completing program requirements will be permitted to return to Concordia for their senior year to fulfill the remaining requirements for graduation. Students will receive guidance from their advisor(s) on remaining coursework to support their future goals, such as the completion of a complementary minor or certificate.

**Transfer Credits and Awarding of Undergraduate Degree**

If a student completes all 29 credits of the first-year of full-time studies at Marquette, the equivalent number of Concordia credits will be accepted toward completion of the student’s undergraduate degree. This would complete the minimum 120 required credits necessary for the Bachelor’s degree at Concordia.



The undergraduate degree will be awarded to the student upon receipt of the transfer credits from Marquette and a subsequent graduation audit by the Concordia Registrar’s office.

Upon completion of all academic requirements prescribed by Marquette, graduates of Concordia and the 3+3 program will be awarded a Juris Doctor.
