# Trial and Appellate Courts

Within the federal court and the state court systems, there is a hierarchy of courts. The first level of court is a trial court or a court of limited jurisdiction, such as traffic court and small claims court. Trial courts accept evidence and testimony to determine what happened in a case. Appellate courts review the decisions of the trial court, without holding a new trial, to determine whether the parties received a fair trial and whether the appropriate law was applied.

## Federal Court System

* Cases are filed in the U.S. District Court. There are 94 judicial districts, named for their geographical area. Some states have a single district; more populous states may have multiple districts.
* The U.S. Department of Justice represents the federal government in civil and criminal cases and assigns attorneys across the 94 districts.
* U.S. District Courts are trial courts that hear civil and criminal cases. At trial, witnesses testify and the testimony is recorded into a trial record.
* The losing party may appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. There are 13 circuit courts in the United States.
* A party losing at the circuit court level may request that the U.S. Supreme Court hear the case; the Constitution requires the Supreme Court to hear only a limited set of appeals.

## State Court System

* A trial court of general jurisdiction hears most types of civil and criminal cases. Names vary by state (e.g., superior court, circuit court, district court).
* States may also have courts of limited jurisdiction (e.g., traffic court, family court, small claims court).
* State trial courts hold trials and preserve a trial record for appellate review.
* In certain cases involving a federal constitutional right, a party that loses at the state supreme court level can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. These cases commonly involve constitutional issues in criminal procedure, evidence collection, or punishment.

## Appellate Review and the Trial Record

* When an appeal is filed, the trial record is forwarded to the appellate court for review.
* Appellate courts do not hold new trials; they cannot recall witnesses or call new witnesses.
* The trial court’s role is fact-finding—determining who did what, when, why, and how. The fact finder (usually the jury) receives substantial deference on factual determinations.
* Appeals are therefore limited to questions of law or legal errors. Because of the deference given to fact finders, appeals are often difficult to win.
