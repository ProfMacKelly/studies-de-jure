# Introduction to Elements of a Contract

In the following sections, we will dive into the three required elements of a contract: (1) [**offer**](../../../../glossary.md#offer), (2) [**acceptance**](../../../../glossary.md#acceptance), and (3) [**consideration**](../../../../glossary.md#consideration). Also, we will see that an [**agreement**](../../../../glossary.md#agreement) is the combination of the offer and the acceptance, and the agreement must reflect the [**mutual assent** ](../../../../glossary.md#mutual-assent)of the parties.

Accordingly, we find \[...] the prevalent idea that there must be a “**meeting of the minds**” (a new phrase at \[the time]) in order to form a contract.\*[^1]

Although agreements may take any form, including unspoken conduct between the parties, they are usually structured in terms of an offer and an acceptance. These two components will be the focus of our discussion in this section. Then, we will turn to the other major functions of contract law: sorting out agreements that are legally binding (i.e., agreements that are contracts that are enforceable in court) from those that are not.
