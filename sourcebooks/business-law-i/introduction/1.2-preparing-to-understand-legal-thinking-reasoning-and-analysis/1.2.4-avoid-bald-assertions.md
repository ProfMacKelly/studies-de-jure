# 1.2.4 Avoid Bald Assertions

## **General Comments**

Some students can have difficulty explaining the rule and performing the reasoning in their analysis (i.e., applying the facts of the case to the requirements of the rule). Frequently, the problem starts with a student failing to explain their reasoning logically, such as (a) making assumptions that certain facts (i.e., evidence) exist that are not provided in the scenario, and (b) making assertions without connecting them to the facts (i.e., evidence) that are provided in the scenario. We call these "bald" assertions. In both the academic and **business** worlds, bald assertions are disregarded; they are useless for any decision-making.

## **Examples of Bald Assertions**

Some students believe that using "because" demonstrates reasoning. Maybe, maybe not: Using "because" sometimes can be insufficient. As you have experienced as students advancing in your education, you have been taught that arguments or assertions need to be connected to "because" in order to support the argument. The concept is true, but the execution is what matters. Frequently, when using "because," people actually incorporate unsubstantiated assumptions and [enthymemes](https://prof-mackelly.gitbook.io/bus-210-2200/preparing-to-understand-legal-thinking-reasoning-and-analysis/introduction-to-deductive-reasoning-rule-based-reasoning#enthymemes).

Here are a few examples of bald assertions.

### **Example 1: "Global warming must be a hoax because my city had its coldest winter ever recorded."**

Certainly, "Global warming is a hoax" is merely a bald assertion because it's not supported by any facts. _**But**_ adding "because" does not fix the problem. The fact that "my city had its coldest winter" is not logically connected to "global warming." Without a definition of "global warming" and facts that fall directly within that definition, the statement is still a bald assertion. The assertion skips the necessary logical steps to constitute a legitimate analysis.

Aside: The fact that the assertion in this example is a bald assertion does not inherently mean that the assertion is false. It simply means that the reasoning is flawed, and it is not a legitimate argument to support the claim that global warming is a hoax.
{% endhint %}

### **Example 2: "A burrito is a sandwich because it is a filling served inside bread."**

* Of course, this has the same problem as the hot dog (the definition of "burrito" and the definition of "sandwich"). But _in addition_ to these definitions, what are a few questions—arising from critical thinking—that need to be answered to make a logical argument about whether a burrito is a sandwich? Here are a few (but not all) questions:
  * Does "bread" include only a flour tortilla, or can it include a corn tortilla (or something else)?
  * Does "inside" mean that the ingredients are incorporated into the "bread," between pieces of "bread," or wrapped in "bread"?
  * If it is wrapped in "bread," is there food that is commonly viewed as a sandwich and also wrapped in "bread"? (For example, based on the common usage of "sandwich," it is hard to disagree that a piece of meat between two slices of bread falls within the meaning of "sandwich." What if there is evidence that the same meat wrapped in a tortilla—commonly referred to as a chicken wrap—is also commonly considered a sandwich? Could this support an argument by analogy that a burrito can be a sandwich because both burritos and some sandwiches are wrapped in a tortilla? Maybe, maybe not.

### **Example 3: "Jack is liable for Jill's alleged injuries because he was speeding when he hit her vehicle."**

* Many people "reason" that because Jack was doing something illegal, he is responsible for Jill's injuries. This is flawed reasoning because it assumes that acting illegally automatically makes someone liable. As you will learn, this is false.
* Now, let's try this with more detail, based on two rules of law (i.e., definitions) from Unit 2:
  * For a driver **to be liable** for the tort of negligence, the alleged wrongdoer must (1) have had a duty to drive with reasonable care to avoid hurting others; (2) the driver must have acted negligently (e.g., failing to drive with regard for others' safety); and (3) the driver's negligence must have been the cause of the injured party's harm. The second rule is that a driver is negligent if they exceed the speed limit.
  * Here, many students look at the word "negligent" and assert that Jack is liable for Jill's injuries because he was speeding when he hit her. Although the student used "because," the reasoning is flawed. It is logical to assert that Jack was negligent because (a) speeding constitutes negligence, and (b) Jack was speeding. But the rule for liability explained above requires more than just negligent conduct, and **liability requires evidence that the negligent conduct&#x20;**_<mark style="color:red;">**caused**</mark>_**&#x20;Jill's injuries**.
  * Without evidence about what caused Jill's injuries, it's entirely possible that Jack's negligence did not cause her alleged injuries (or at least not all of them). For instance, she could have had the same injuries before the accident, and the accident did not make them worse (i.e., she could have been in the exact same condition before and after Jack's negligent conduct). If there was evidence that she had pre-existing injuries, we cannot assume that Jack's negligence caused the injuries that Jill is claiming.
