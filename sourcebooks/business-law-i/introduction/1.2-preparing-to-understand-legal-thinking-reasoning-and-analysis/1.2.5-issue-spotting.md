# 1.2.5 Issue Spotting

As referenced [earlier](../../introduction-to-american-law-and-the-legal-system/1.1-the-relationship-between-business-and-law.md#seven-management-skills-necessary-for-business-success), the top of the list of seven management skills necessary for business success, by [Ladwig & Siedel](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], is the ability to **recognize legal issues that arise daily**. What does this mean? Lawyers refer to the recognition of legal issues as "issue spotting." In essence, issue spotting involves observing a set of circumstances and identifying _actual and potential_ legal concerns that may bubble up. Being able to do this helps businesses (1) respond promptly and (2) proactively prevent or minimize future legal risk. Because businesses often get into disputes over contracts, we'll illustrate the point in the context of contracts.

Maybe your job involves entering into contracts with other businesses. Your business thinks you are doing the smart thing by putting the contracts in writing—and frankly, you are—_but what do your contracts say_? I have seen many circumstances in which businesses want to "keep things simple," which _can_ work, but it _can also_ get businesses in trouble. I find that when businesses say that they want a contract to be "simple," they tend to mean "short." In reality, "short" does not mean "simple"; sometimes, a "short" contract achieves the opposite and _creates_ problems.

### **How Do You Like Them Apples?**

Here is a seemingly short and simple contractual situation[^2]: Mike and Sally put an agreement in writing, which says that on June 10, 2024, Mike will buy 10 apples and deliver them to Sally no later than 1:00 pm on that day in exchange for $20. Simple enough, right? Wrong. Even disregarding the issue of the apples' sizes or weight, what species of apples did Sally want: Granny Smith, Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Honeycrisp, McIntosh, Gala, etc.? The taste of a given apple species can vary widely. The problem is that this "simple" agreement to purchase and deliver "apples" creates ambiguities. Of course, it would be silly for this dispute to end up in court. But, if the case involved a substantially larger sum of money, Sally has a problem because the first thing a court will do is examine whether the terms of the contract are ambiguous (i.e., subject to [more than one objectively reasonable interpretation](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]), and [she is the party](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] that controlled the use of "apple" as a term in the contract.

### "Fowl" Language

If the apple case example seems unrealistic, we will take a gander at the famous "chicken case": [_Frigaliment Importing Co. v. B.N.S. International Sales Corp._](#user-content-fn-5)[^5] This case involved an international contract dispute, and the issue was the meaning of one "simple" word: chicken. Frigaliment—a Swiss corporation—made commercial purchases of 200,000 lbs. of frozen "chicken" to be shipped to Switzerland from B.N.S.—a New York state corporation. But the purchaser did not receive the chicken they thought they agreed to, so they sued the seller, claiming that it received lower quality chicken than it purchased under the terms of the contract. This contract _**was in writing**_, so one might think this dispute should have been settled easily. The parties can simply look at the words on the contract.

The problem—as we will see when we study contract law—is that the parties were not actually on the same page about what was being purchased and sold (in contract terminology, the parties did not have "a meeting of the minds"). Despite the contract being in writing, there was a significant problem that neither business spotted when reviewing the contract: The contract did not contain any definitions of the products being purchased, only quantity and price. The parties thought they both understood what "chicken" was. They were wrong.

The purchaser claimed that "[it understood](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]" that "chicken" referred to the (higher quality) young chickens used for broiling and frying. The seller claimed that "chicken" meant "any bird of that genus that meets contract specifications on weight and quality, including what it calls 'stewing chicken' and \[the purchaser] pejoratively terms "fowl[^7]." Complicating matters, the contract was written predominantly in German, although the English word, "chicken," was used. German, however, uses [multiple words ](#user-content-fn-8)[^8]for "chicken," all with different meanings (e.g., one word refers for broiling, one word for "stewing," and one word that encompassed both, [according to the purchaser](#user-content-fn-9)[^9]).

Ultimately, after considering various sources, such as dictionary definitions, customary trade and industry usage of "chicken," the familiarity of the parties with trade and industry usage, definitions by [governmental regulations](#user-content-fn-10)[^10], and the [plain, "objective meaning"](#user-content-fn-11)[^11] of "chicken," the court held in favor of the seller and dismissed the buyer's lawsuit.

In the end, much of the _**200,000 lbs.**_ of poultry the plaintiff paid for was a loss because the company spent more money than it intended for the type of "chicken" it thought it had purchased. This is an issue even an undergraduate business law student should have spotted when the contract was being negotiated and written.
