<summary><mark style="color:red;"><strong>How Annotations Work in This Sourcebook</strong></mark></summary>

The sourcebook's text includes many annotations, which are indicated by text with a dotted underline like this: [This text is annotated.](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] To read the annotation, hover (mouse) over the underlined text. A bubble will appear and display the annotation. (If the bubble does not appear when hovering, then click/tap it.) These annotations provide additional context and information while also decluttering the main reading area.
