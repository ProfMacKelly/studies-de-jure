# 1.1.4 More on "It Depends"

For example, a brief search of YouTube, TikTok, and other social media sites reveal a plethora of videos depicting law enforcement officers asserting that citizens are required to provide their identification or personal information (e.g., name, date of birth, address, explanations of their presence, etc.). Are these officers correct? _**It depends.**_ This is a fictional, but realistic, example:

> \[_Citizen walking on a public sidewalk, and officer approaches._]
>
> **Officer:** How are you doing today?
>
> Citizen: Good, thanks.
>
> **Officer:** Where are you going?
>
> Citizen: I don't need to tell you.
>
> **Officer:** Do you have identification?
>
> Citizen: Yes, but I'm not going to give it to you.
>
> \[_Officer removes notepad from pocket to take notes_.]
>
> **Officer:** What is your name?
>
> Citizen: l'm not telling you.
>
> **Officer:** Look, I'm not trying to be difficult. We received a call about a suspicious person walking around on this block, so we're investigating.
>
> Citizen: Okay. Well, I'm just walking.&#x20;
>
> **Officer:** Sir, we received a call about a suspicious person and we're investigating that call. We're talking to you as part of that investigation. So, when we talk to someone during and investigation, we always get their name so we know who we're talking to. Tell me your name.
>
> Citizen: I'm not giving you my name. Am I being detained?
>
> **Officer:** No. You're not in trouble, we're just investigating a call about suspicious behavior. Now, you're refusing to tell me who you are. That's pretty suspicious to me. Give me your name.
>
> Citizen: I'm not telling you that.
>
> **Officer:** Sir, we just need to know who we're talking to. Now, give me your name. That is a lawful order.
>
> Citizen: No, I don't need to.
>
> **Officer:** Yes, you do.
>
> Citizen: No, I don't.
>
> **Officer:** Listen, you are required to give me your ID or tell me who you are. We need to verify who you are. If you aren't gonna comply, then I'm going to have to arrest you for obstruction. We are investigating a call about suspcious activity and you are obstructing that investigation.

Is the officer correct that the order to produce identification or provide their name was a lawful order? It depends on a few things. Here are just a few examples:

* Was there reasonable suspicion, merely based on "a call" about a "suspicious" person, to believe that the citizen had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime? Without reasonable suspicion, a citizen has no obligation to disclose their identity; and merely being or acting "suspicious" does not constitute reasonable suspicion that the person was, is, or is about to be engaged in criminal activity.
* What is the state law?&#x20;
  * Some states make it an offense to refuse to identify oneself _if_ the police stopped the citizen based on reasonable suspicion. Some states do not. For instance:
    * [In Ohio](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], it is a misdemeanor in Ohio to refuse to disclose one's name, address, or date of birth under certain circumstances when reasonable suspicion exists.&#x20;
    * [In Wisconsin](#user-content-fn-2)[^2], although law enforcement may "demand the name and address of the person and an explanation of the person's conduct" when reasonable suspicion exists, a simple refusal to comply with the demand is not a crime. Wisconsin has no equivalent to Ohio's "[failure to disclose](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-2921.29)" statute. Moreover, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that a simple refusal to comply with the demand does not constitute the crime of resisting or obstructing an officer.\*[^3]
