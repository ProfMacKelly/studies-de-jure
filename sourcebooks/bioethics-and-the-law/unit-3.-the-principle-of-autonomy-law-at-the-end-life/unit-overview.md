# Unit Overview

> No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend’s or of thine own were: any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.

[Unit 2](/broken/pages/N7mSdVnYnOnjCMdkUHAf) examined the role of the patient (and doctors) in making decisions about medical treatment. This unit focuses on when to end it; more specifically, how autonomy comes into view when decisions must be made at the end of life, and how the law regulates those decisions. For decades, questions about the failure to provide or continue medical care needed by a patient to stay alive prompted discussion of criminal behavior, punishable as homicide. But over time, it became increasingly clear that the law on paper—“You must always treat a patient”—was being regularly disregarded. Patients were requesting, and doctors were permitting—sometimes even actively hastening—death.

The cases in this unit consider several questions:

* How do we define “death”?
* Does the principle of autonomy permit a dying patient to refuse treatment?
* What about a patient who is not dying? How is this different than suicide?

## **About This Week**

This week, the cases examine several key issues. First is the problem of defining death. Is a person in a persistent vegetative state “alive”? Or is “breain death” the proper criterion? Does that require the whole brain? How relevant are considerations of rationality, consciousness, or personal identity?\
The second issue is the stopping of treatment. Can a patient can refuse treatment, even if this means death? How is the answer different when a patient who is dying, and when a patient is not dying? Is this tantamount to suicide? Does the State have an interest in preventing it?

## **Learning Objectives**

1. Summarize the different definitions of “death” as they pertain to ending medical treatment.
2. Analyze the distinctions between the refusal of life-saving medical treatment vs. intentional action taken to hasten death, and between the refusal of medical treatment when the patient is dying vs. when the patient is not dying.
3. Justify the interests of the State in preserving life and preventing suicide.
4. Apply a Christian understanding of life, death, and personhood in light of the tenuous nature of patient autonomy.
