# The Legal System in the United States

 Procedure: A Sourcebook

_Criminal Procedure: A Sourcebook_ is an [open educational resource](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], focusing on the balance between the public interest in controlling, investigating, and prosecuting criminal conduct and the private interest of individuals in protecting their reasonable expectation of privacy and protecting against arbitrary government deprivations of liberty and property.

The resource is intended for undergraduate students. Depending on an institution's prescribed learning objectives, this resource may fit the needs of undergraduate courses criminal procedure and constitutional law in criminal justice.

> The requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has this vital role in our criminal procedure for cogent reasons. The accused, during a criminal prosecution, has at stake interests of immense importance, both because of the possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and because of the certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction. Accordingly, a society that values the good name and freedom of every individual should not condemn a man for commission of a crime when there is reasonable doubt about his guilt.&#x20;
