Editing to the [original](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17920279791882194984\&q=521+U.S.+702\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50) by Matthew L. Mac Kelly. Many of the court's original citations to authorities and other content may have been omitted for length and readability purposes. Many elisions are not identified, particularly string citations and original footnotes when not materially necessary to the subject of the lesson. However, some elisions are identified by bracketed ellipses (e.g., \[...]).
