The sourcebook's text includes many annotations, which are indicated by text with a dotted underline like this: [This text is annotated.](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] To read the annotation, mouse over the underlined text and click/tap. A bubble will appear and display the annotation. These annotations provide additional context and information while also decluttering the main reading area.&#x20;

Also, instead of traditional footnotes or endnotes, many references and citations to original source content are located in these annotations.
