Supreme Court of Wisconsin

**ESTATE OF Donald E. CAVANAUGH et al.**\
**v.**\
**Robert ANDRADE and City of Milwaukee; Gary Allen ZERGOSKI.**

## Opinion

ANN WALSH BRADLEY, J.

The plaintiffs, Estate of Donald Cavanaugh and James Cavanaugh, seek review, and the defendants, City of Milwaukee and police officer Robert Andrade, seek cross-review of a decision of the court of appeals that reversed a judgment against the City and affirmed a judgment against Andrade, which was entered by the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County ... .[1](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#footnote_1_1) The City and Andrade assert immunity from liability for the injuries and death of Donald Cavanaugh which resulted from a collision with a vehicle being pursued by Andrade during a high-speed chase. Because the City has a ministerial duty to have a written policy for high-speed chases which includes consideration of the severity of the offense, we conclude that the City is not immune from liability. We also conclude that there is credible evidence to support the jury's verdict finding that the City breached its duty. Further, because Andrade's decisions to initiate and continue the chase were discretionary, we conclude that he is immune from liability. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals.

### I. FACTS

The issues in this case arise out of a high-speed pursuit involving Andrade and a vehicle driven by Gary Zergoski. Late in the evening on January 13, 1989, Andrade was approaching the intersection of South 35th Street and West Forest Home Avenue when he observed Zergoski pass several stopped vehicles and speed through a solid red traffic signal controlling the intersection. Andrade turned at the intersection and increased his speed to follow Zergoski.

Andrade activated his emergency lights and siren approximately two blocks later, which caused Zergoski to begin to pull over. However, Zergoski again fled at a high rate of speed and turned onto 39th Street. Approximately six to seven blocks later, Andrade observed Zergoski's vehicle stalled in an intersection. Andrade was able to approach close enough to observe Zergoski's license plate number, which he relayed to the dispatcher. Zergoski restarted his vehicle and again fled at a high rate of speed along West Morgan Avenue, which is a main arterial street within a primarily residential neighborhood.

At the intersection of 60th Street and Morgan, Zergoski went through another red light and collided with a vehicle driven by Donald Cavanaugh. According to witnesses, Zergoski was \[traveling] between 60 and 80 miles per hour approximately two blocks prior to this intersection. Andrade estimated that he was approximately one block away from this collision when it occurred. A witness testified that Andrade was within approximately one-half block of Zergoski's vehicle when it entered the intersection. In all, the pursuit spanned approximately 17 blocks. As a result of the collision, Cavanaugh died after spending five months in a coma.

James Cavanaugh, Donald's father, sued the City, Andrade, and Zergoski, individually and as administrator of Donald's estate. The case was ultimately tried to a jury, which found the City 23% negligent with respect to implementation of its high-speed pursuit policy, Andrade 2% negligent with respect to the operation of his vehicle, and Zergoski 75% negligent.&#x20;

### III. CITY OF MILWAUKEE

\[...]

#### B. Negligence

Having concluded that § 346.03(6) imposes a ministerial duty on the City, we next consider whether the City was negligent in carrying out its duty. Cavanaugh alleged that the City was negligent because its pursuit policy failed to advise its officers to consider the severity of the crime when deciding to initiate or continue a chase as mandated by § 346.03(6). The jury found that the City was 23% causally negligent with respect to the implementation of its high-speed pursuit policy. The City argued in its motion for [judgment notwithstanding the verdict](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/judgment_notwithstanding_the_verdict) that it was immune from liability. The circuit court denied the motion, concluding that the application of governmental immunity for negligence in high-speed pursuits required public policy considerations more properly made by an appellate court.

When the circuit court does not make an analysis of the evidence sustaining the verdict, as here, an appellate court must review the record as a matter of first impression to see if there is any credible evidence to support the verdict. ... In order to establish the City's liability for damages, Cavanaugh must show: (1) that the City breached its ministerial duty; and (2) a causal connection between the City's conduct and his son's injury and subsequent death. ...

The evidence shows that the City's policy states in relevant part:

> 2\. Department Vehicle Operators

> **a)** A Department vehicle operator shall only engage in a motor vehicle pursuit when:

> (1) He/she has activated the emergency roof lights and siren if in a marked vehicle or has activated the emergency light and siren....

> 2\) He notifies the Communications Division dispatcher of the pertinent facts concerning the pursuit and requests assistance

> (3) The speeds involved and/or the maneuvering practices engaged in permit the Department vehicle operator complete control of his vehicle and do not create unwarranted danger to the public or Department members.

> (4) The volume of pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic permits continuing the pursuit.

> (5) Weather and road conditions are not such that the pursuit becomes inordinately hazardous.

> **b)** Police officers engaged in the motor vehicle pursuit of a driver who is an IMMEDIATE threat to the safety of the public may take reasonable and prudent measures to apprehend the driver without endangering the welfare of others. However, the deliberate striking of a pursued vehicle or the use of a Department or other vehicle(s) as a stationary barricade is only permitted to be used as a last resort when:

> (1) The occupant(s) of the vehicle being pursued is wanted for a serious felony, or

> (2) The manner in which the pursued vehicle is being operated creates a substantial risk of serious injury or death.

> **c)** The Department vehicle operator or supervisor shall terminate a motor vehicle pursuit when in his/her judgment further pursuit is not warranted. Some examples of items to be considered are the volume of pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic, road and weather hazards or the distance between vehicles indicates that further pursuit will create more danger to the public and/or Department members than does the conduct of the pursued driver.

\[City of Milwaukee, Order # 9491, January 30, 1987]

The City asserts that it did not breach its ministerial duty because its policy complies with § 346.03(6). According to the City, the statute gives it discretion to decide which part of its guidelines include consideration of the severity of the crime. The City argues that it properly exercised that discretion by concluding that the severity of the crime factor should only be considered in determining whether to strike a fleeing vehicle or set up a roadblock.

\[...]

\[T]he evidence shows that the City's policy fails to consider the severity of the crime with respect to pursuing at excessive speeds as required under § 346.03(6). The City's policy states that a department vehicle operator _shall only engage in a motor vehicle pursuit when:_ (1) the officer has activated the vehicle's emergency lights, (2) the officer notifies the dispatcher of the pertinent facts and requests assistance, (3) the speeds do not create an unwarranted danger to the public or department members, (4) the volume of pedestrian or vehicular traffic permits continuing the pursuit, and (5) weather and road conditions do not make the pursuit inordinately hazardous. None of the factors include any reference to the severity of crime.

Therefore, we disagree with the City \[...] that the reference to the severity of crime elsewhere in the City's policy is adequate to comply with the mandate of § 346.03(6). The evidence shows that the City's policy considers the severity of the crime only in roadblocks and in striking a fleeing vehicle, when a serious felony is involved. However, there is no consideration of the severity of the crime when a person is being pursued for a misdemeanor or a traffic offense, as here.

\[S]triking and barricading occur in only a limited number of police pursuits. \[...] The City's policy of considering the severity of the crime only with respect to these limited aspects of police pursuits directly contravenes the language of § 346.03(6). Therefore, we conclude that there is credible evidence to support the jury's verdict that the City was negligent with respect to the implementation of its pursuit policy.

#### C. Causation

Although we conclude that the record is sufficient to sustain the jury's finding of negligence, our review does not end there. The court of appeals erroneously concluded that if the City breached its ministerial duty by failing to comply with § 346.03(6), then liability attaches. \[...] As noted above, Cavanaugh must also prove causation between the City's defective pursuit policy and his damages. \[...]

The test for determining causation is whether the conduct at issue was a substantial factor in producing the injury. \[...] This question is generally one of fact for the jury, and we must sustain the jury's finding "if there is any credible evidence under any reasonable view or any reasonable inferences derived therefrom that support \[it]." \[...]

Cavanaugh's theory regarding causation was that had the City's policy properly stated that the severity of the crime should be considered in determining whether to initiate and continue a pursuit, the pursuit here would have been terminated prior to the accident because the chase arose out of minor traffic violations. However, the fact that the City's policy was defective cannot be considered causal if either Andrade or his supervising officer, who was monitoring the chase, considered the severity of the crime despite the defective policy. Therefore, in order to determine whether the City's defective policy was a substantial factor in producing the injury, we first review the record to determine whether either Andrade or his supervisor considered the severity of the crime.[5](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#footnote_1_5)

On adverse examination, Andrade testified that upon initiating the pursuit, the only known crimes that Zergoski had committed were speeding and going through a red light. He also stated that based on these initial traffic violations he suspected that Zergoski was intoxicated. However, other than additional speeding and going through more traffic signals, he did not note any subsequent conduct to substantiate his belief that Zergoski was intoxicated.[6](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#footnote_1_6) Andrade further testified that he never considered terminating the pursuit during the entire period because he did not believe, based on the lack of traffic, that Zergoski's actions were endangering others on the road.[7](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#footnote_1_7)

Andrade's testimony on direct examination in the City's case differed somewhat. He testified that the main reason that he continued the pursuit was his suspicion that Zergoski was intoxicated and that his reckless driving posed a threat to the public. He further stated that he was convinced that Zergoski was not going to stop, and that he wanted to be close enough so that other drivers at intersections would be warned by his siren and flashing lights.

Andrade's supervising officer, Buechner, was specifically asked which factors he considered in terms of his decision to allow the chase to continue. He testified that he considered pedestrian and vehicle traffic, the residential neighborhood, the road conditions, and the fact Andrade was an experienced officer. When counsel pointed out to Buechner on cross-examination that he did not state that he considered the severity of the crime, he stated that it "slipped my mind when I answered the question."

In assessing the jury's finding of causation, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. \[...] Further, the credibility of witnesses and the weight given to their testimony are matters left to the jury's judgment. \[...]

Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict, we conclude that a reasonable view of the evidence is that neither Andrade nor Buechner considered the severity of the crime — minor traffic violations — in determining to continue the pursuit. The record indicates that Andrade never explicitly stated that he considered the severity of the crime in deciding to initiate or continue the pursuit. It is true that he testified that his decision to continue the pursuit was based on a suspicion that Zergoski was intoxicated and a threat to the public. However, he also testified that the only crimes he knew for a fact that Zergoski had committed were the initial traffic violations, and that he never considered terminating the pursuit because Zergoski's actions were not endangering others on the road.

Buechner also never explicitly stated that he considered the severity of the offense in this case. On cross-examination he implied that he did in fact consider the severity of the crime by stating that he simply forgot to mention it. However, the jury in its credibility determination could have relied on his initial answer in which he did not state that he considered the severity of the crime.

Having concluded that there is credible evidence in the record for the jury to conclude that neither Andrade nor his supervisor considered the severity of the crime, we next turn to the essential question of whether there is credible evidence to support the jury's finding that the City's defective policy was a substantial factor in the accident.[8](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#footnote_1_8) First, Zergoski testified at trial that he intended to flee and disobey traffic signals as long as Andrade continued to chase him. However, he also testified that he only wanted to get away from Andrade so that he could get out of the car and escape on foot. Zergoski testified that if Andrade had stopped chasing him, he would have no longer been speeding or running red lights.[9](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#footnote_1_9)

In addition to the testimony of Andrade, Buechner, and Zergoski, Cavanaugh's expert witness, Leonard Territo, explicitly testified as to causation. Territo characterized Andrade's failure to consider whether to terminate the pursuit after he realized that Zergoski was not going to stop as "astounding" in light of the dangerousness of the pursuit. He also testified that he believed that Andrade's failure to terminate the pursuit was a substantial factor in causing the accident based on the following rationale:

> As long as the police officer continues pursuing, the violator will continue to flee from the officer. The theory of course is this, the whole reason for termination is that when you terminate a pursuit, eventually and invariably the individual will slow the speed down. The sooner you do it, the sooner you remove the impetus for the individual to continue to flee; and that's the whole basis for terminating pursuit, to remove the incentive for the violator to continue going through stop signs, red lights, and driving almost three times over the speed limit.

When asked to consider the significance of Zergoski's testimony that he intended to leave the car upon eluding Andrade, Territo explained that:

> \[I]f in fact the violator intends to terminate, to bail out of the car three blocks away, what it means is that if the pursuit is terminated where I say, that the vehicle never reaches the point where the accident occurred. He abandons his car, gets out and runs and the accident doesn't occur.

Territo also testified as to the role of the supervising officer. According to Territo, a policy instructing a supervising officer to consider the severity of the offense would have resulted in the chase being stopped in this case. Territo explained the role of the supervising officer in a chase as follows:

> \[0]nce the supervisor knows what the violation is, the supervisor can assess how much latitude the patrol officer should be given. What happens, the patrol officer gets caught in the pursuit .... The sergeant who is not involved hopefully is dispassionate at that point and perhaps is in a better position to make a decision .... It's the hopes that cooler heads will prevail and neutralize the natural inclination of the officer to continue because the person is running from him.

The [dissent ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/dissent)to this section discounts Territo's testimony because "\[a]n expert's opinion that some hypothetical officer would have chosen not to continue the chase, and therefore the accident would never have happened, does not provide the necessary link between the City's failure to perform its ministerial duty and the damages in this case." Justice Geske's dissent at 337. However, Territo's testimony was not limited to a "hypothetical officer." Rather, he testified that under this specific fact situation, the City's defective policy was a substantial factor in causing Cavanaugh's injuries. Where more than one inference can be drawn from the evidence, this court must accept the inference drawn by the jury. _.._.

The dissent also criticizes Territo's testimony on the ground that it is mere speculation to conclude that the chase would have stopped prior to the accident had Andrade and his supervisor been properly informed by the City's policy. Since we have initially determined that the City is not immune from liability, we conclude that issues of causal negligence are properly for the jury's consideration. The United States Supreme Court in _Canton v. Harris,_ [489 U.S. 378](https://static.case.law/us/489/0378-01), 391 (1989), reached a similar conclusion when discussing the necessary showing of causation for a [42 U.S.C. § 1983](https://static.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983) liability claim based on inadequacy of police training:

> Predicting how a hypothetically well-trained officer would have acted under the circumstances may not be an easy task for the factfinder, particularly since matters of judgment may be involved, and since officers who are well trained are not free from error and might perhaps react very much like the untrained officer in similar circumstances. But judge and jury, doing their respective jobs, will be adequate to the task.

The dissent addresses what it determines to be disturbing public policy implications of this opinion. The dissent states that a non-defective policy "would encompass a presumption that continuation of pursuit is justified only for major offenses and those involving other violations should be terminated." Justice Geske's dissent at 338. Nothing in this opinion or in § 346.03(6) creates such a presumption. Section 346.03(6) only requires that law enforcement agencies have a pursuit policy that mandates that officers consider the severity of the crime when exceeding speed limits in pursuit of actual or suspected violators, not that the severity of the crime is dispositive in an officer's decision.

Further, this case is not about the propriety of high-speed chases and officers being stripped of their discretion.[10](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#footnote_1_10) The court should neither advance perceived public policy considerations nor decide the case based on these perceived considerations. The legislature has spoken by setting out the public policy considerations in § 346.03(6), which balance the need to apprehend suspects with the dangers inherent in high-speed chases. The legislature has determined that it is good public policy to require an officer engaging in a high-speed chase to consider the severity of the offense in relation to the danger posed by the chase. We agree with the dissent to this section that imposing such a balancing test may be difficult in the "compact and intense framework of a high-speed pursuit." Justice Geske's dissent ... . Nevertheless, this is the determination mandated by the legislature, not this court.

Based on the above, we conclude that there is credible evidence to support the jury's verdict that the City was 23% causally negligent with respect to its defective pursuit policy. Therefore, we reverse the court of appeals' decision as to the City.

### IV. ANDRADE

\[...]

#### B. Causal Negligence

Although Cavanaugh proceeded on the theories that Andrade was negligent for continuing the chase and negligent in the operation of the vehicle, the case was properly submitted to the jury solely on the question of negligent operation. The jury answered "yes" to the following special verdict question: "At and immediately prior to the accident of January 13, 1989, was the defendant, Robert Andrade, negligent with respect to the operation of the motor vehicle." The jury also found that such negligence was a cause of the accident.

Cavanaugh argues that the jury could have properly found Andrade negligent because: (1) Andrade was driving too fast for conditions; (2) Andrade's speed may have caused Zergoski to drive faster; and (3) Andrade was following too closely. Additionally, Cavanaugh's complaint alleged that Andrade was negligent with respect to "lookout" and "management and control" of his vehicle. The court of appeals noted that there was testimony in the record that Andrade's speed may have been too fast for conditions and that the roads were slippery with patches of ice. It concluded that this provided sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of negligence. _.._.

Although it is necessary to discuss Andrade's alleged negligence in the operation of his vehicle in order to set the framework for determining whether such negligence was causal, we need not decide the issue of negligence based on the facts of this case. Because we conclude that the issue of causation is dispositive, we decline to further consider whether the evidence supports the jury's finding of negligence. _.._.

Turning to the question of causation, we first address the evidence of negligence identified by both the court of appeals and Cavanaugh that Andrade engaged in excessive speeds or speeds too fast for conditions. As discussed above, reliance on this evidence is misplaced because it relates directly to Andrade's discretionary decision to continue the high-speed pursuit.

We next look to Cavanaugh's remaining arguments in support of the jury's verdict which properly relate to Andrade's alleged negligence in the physical operation of his vehicle. He asserts that Andrade failed to maintain management and control, was following too closely, and failed to maintain proper lookout. However, the fact that Andrade's vehicle was between one-half and one block behind Zergoski at the time of the accident and did not make any physical contact with either vehicle undercuts those arguments because they lack the causal connection necessary between the alleged negligence and Cavanaugh's injuries.

For example, Cavanaugh argues that the jury could have determined that Andrade was negligent in the operation of his vehicle with respect to management and control. The duty of management and control requires a driver to keep his or her vehicle under control so that when danger appears, the driver may stop, reduce speeds, change course, or take other proper means to avoid injury or damage. Wis \[Jury Instruction] — Civil 1105. Here, Andrade did not collide with either vehicle.

Cavanaugh also alleged that Andrade was following too closely. However, the nearest that any witness placed Andrade's vehicle behind Zergoski's vehicle at the time of the collision was one-half block. Operators of vehicles should space themselves at a distance that will ensure proper braking and reaction time in the event that the preceding vehicle slows or stops. _See_ Wis \[Jury Instruction] — Civil 1112 "Operation of Automobile Following Another." This court has previously recognized that "the purpose of holding a trailing driver to a proper distance is to keep him in position to stop or so control his car as to prevent him from doing injury because of the action of the car ahead, whatever be the cause of that action ...." _Northland Ins. Co. v. Avis Rent-A-Car,_ [62 Wis. 2d 643](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1921265/northland-insurance-v-avis-rent-a-car/), 648 (1974) ... . Since Andrade did not collide with the preceding vehicles, any evidence regarding proper distances for braking or reaction time to prevent injury is irrelevant to the question of causation.

Cavanaugh's claim that the jury could have determined that Andrade was negligent as to lookout is also unpersuasive. A driver has the duty to exercise ordinary care to keep a careful lookout ahead and about him or her for other vehicles that may be within or approaching the driver's course of travel. Wis \[Jury Instruction] — Civil 1055. Again, even assuming [_arguendo_ ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/arguendo)that Andrade was negligent in this respect, such negligence was not causal because Andrade did not collide with either vehicle. Andrade's failure to maintain proper lookout could not be a substantial factor in the accident because it would have occurred regardless of Andrade's negligent lookout.

Based on the above, we conclude that there is no credible evidence in the record for a reasonable jury to find that any alleged negligence of Andrade with respect to the physical operation of his motor vehicle was a substantial factor in causing the accident. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals' decision affirming the jury's verdict finding Andrade 2% causally negligent and direct the circuit court to grant Andrade's motion for judgment notwithstanding the jury's verdict.

\[...]

_By the Court._ — The decision of the court of appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to the circuit court to enter judgment consistent with this opinion.

[5](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#footnote_1_5) The dissent erroneously asserts that the majority has "mischaracterized" the causation analysis as "hinging" on whether Andrade or his supervisor considered the severity of the crime. Justice Geske's dissent at 333. As we expressly state at the outset of this discussion, we employ the substantial factor test when analyzing the existence of causation. As we further discuss below, the essential question is whether there is any credible evidence to support the jury's finding that the City's policy was a substantial factor in producing Cavanaugh's injuries. However, we would not even reach that question if the record conclusively establishes that either Andrade or his supervisor considered the severity of the crime despite the City's defective policy.

[6](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#ref_footnote_1_6) Although Andrade did not specifically identify any additional conduct which substantiated his belief that Zergoski was intoxicated, he testified that he observed Zergoski's vehicle "fishtail" when speeding around one corner. He also testified that Zergoski weaved slightly during one stretch, which he attributed to over-acceleration.

[7](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#ref_footnote_1_7) Although the dissent to this section relies on a long excerpt from Andrade's testimony in which he testified that [\*308](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#p308)public safety was best served by continuing the pursuit, it neglects to acknowledge the following contrary testimony that Andrade did not believe Zergoski's actions were endangering the public at any point prior to the accident:

> Q. Did you believe that during the pursuit that Zergoski's actions were endangering the welfare of others on the road?

> A. There was no traffic at that time ... on the road we were on — couldn't have hurt anybody.

> Q. So your answer then is no, that during the pursuit his actions did not endanger others on the road?

> A. Right.

> Q. At any time during the pursuit?

> A. No.

> Q. And you don't believe, do you, that your continuing to chase him at any point prior to the accident created unwarranted danger to the public, do you?

> A. No.

[8](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#ref_footnote_1_8) The dissent to this section agrees that this court applies the "any credible evidence" standard when reviewing a jury's finding of causation. However, the dissent then ignores this standard by creating a more onerous standard on review. It asserts that the plaintiff had the burden to prove that: (1) if the written policy required officers to consider the severity of the crime, (2) then, Officer Andrade would have terminated the chase, and (3) Zergoski would have slowed down or stopped his vehicle and averted the collision. Justice Geske's dissent at 333-34. The dissent then proceeds to show, selecting only favorable evidence, that Cavanaugh failed to meet his burden of proof as to these causal links, asserting that any finding of causation in this case can only be based on impermissible speculation and unproved assumption. However, the question on this review is not whether this court is of the opinion that the plaintiff met his burden of proof. Rather, the question is whether there is any credible evidence for the jury to believe that the defective policy was a substantial factor in producing Cavanaugh's injuries.

[9](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#ref_footnote_1_9) Zergoski testified in part as follows:

> [\*311](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#p311)Q. \[City Attorney] You were going to go through as many red lights and as many stop lights as there were between 35th and Forest Home and your house in Waukesha to get home that night, weren't you, to keep away from the police officers?

> A. No, I just wanted to get away.

> Q. \[Cavanaugh's counsel] And if that officer had stopped chasing you, it was your plan, was it not, to park your car, get out of it and run, wasn't it?

> A. Yes.

> Q. So if the officer had stopped chasing you, you would have no longer been running red lights, would you have?

> A. No.

> Q. You would have no longer been speeding, would you have?

> A. No.

> Q. Because you would have been out of your car; correct?

> A. Yeah.
