# Marquette 3+3 Proposal Final

**Proposal: Marquette University Law School &**

**Concordia University Wisconsin Accelerated 3+3 Agreement**

In the late summer of 2024, Drs. Scott Niederjohn and Rachel Ware Carlton initiated exploratory conversations with Marquette University to consider entering into an agreement to offer an accelerated 3+3 Pre-Law program. This partnership would establish a mutually beneficial academic program that will permit eligible matriculated Concordia undergraduates to enroll at Marquette after completing three years of undergraduate education at CUW. Students will be able to complete their undergraduate degree from Concordia and Juris Doctor Degre from Marquette in six years. This is an accelerated pathway that reduces the overall time to complete both degrees by a full year. Additionally, this program will further spotlight Concordia’s strength as a “Pre-professional” University to raise the profile of Concordia and prepare CUW to enter into similar agreements with additional Schools of Law.

**Program Overview**

**Students will be awarded a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree from Concordia University following successful completion of the first year of law school at Marquette**. If a CUW student enrolls at Marquette under the program, the student begins full-time legal studies at Marquette the following fall semester, which will be dually credited as the student’s fourth year of undergraduate study at Concordia.

Concordia will allow students to apply for entrance into the 3+3 program any time before the start of the first semester of the sophomore year. Students who wish to apply after this timeframe may not be eligible to meet program requirements. Eligibility of late applicants can be assessed by the Pre-Law advisor and staff advisor.

CUW students participating in the 3+3 program will be permitted to apply for admission to Marquette during their junior year and will be considered for admission to Marquette **if the following conditions are met:**

* The student will have successfully completed 91 credits of coursework as outlined by Concordia’s prelaw advisor and the student’s academic advisor by the end of the junior year of undergraduate study;
* By the end of the junior year or undergraduate study, the student will need no more than 29 credits remaining to complete Concordia graduate requirements;
* The student must take the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT);
* The Registrar of CUW has provided a letter of certification, submitted with the student’s law school application, stating the student meets the requirements outlined in the program MOU (see Appendix A)
* The student must meet all application and deposit deadlines of Marquette;
* The student shall be subject to a character and fitness examination by the Law School’s Admissions and Recruitment Committee.

Students who begin the program and choose not to apply or continue to Marquette may withdraw from the program at any time. They are not required to apply to Marquette University. Students who have been accepted to Marquette University are not required to matriculate and may choose to remain at Concordia for their senior year.

There is no admission guarantee to CUW students within the 3+3 program.

Marquette will consider applicants from the program for all scholarships and financial aid on an equal basis with all other applicants to Marquette Law School. Students are considered graduate/professional students for purposes of financial aid.

Concordia 3+3 students who are not admitted to Marquette after completing program requirements will be permitted to return to Concordia for their senior year to fulfill the remaining requirements for graduation. Students will receive guidance from their advisor(s) on remaining coursework to support their future goals, such as the completion of a complementary minor or certificate.

**Transfer Credits and Awarding of Undergraduate Degree**

If a student completes all 29 credits of the first-year of full-time studies at Marquette, the equivalent number of Concordia credits will be accepted toward completion of the student’s undergraduate degree. This would complete the minimum 120 required credits necessary for the Bachelor’s degree at Concordia.

The undergraduate degree will be awarded to the student upon receipt of the transfer credits from Marquette and a subsequent graduation audit by the Concordia Registrar’s office.

Upon completion of all academic requirements prescribed by Marquette, graduates of Concordia and the 3+3 program will be awarded a Juris Doctor.

**Exclusivity**

This partnership would not be exclusive. Marquette University has established similar agreements with other schools, including [Ripon College,](https://ripon.edu/area/pre-law-scholars-program/) [Wisconsin Lutheran College](https://www.wlc.edu/academics/programs/law.html), and [St. Norbert College](https://www.snc.edu/academics/pre-professional/pre-law/partnership.html).

**Student Tracking & Application**

CUW students may indicate interest in the program in the following ways:

* Students may select “Pre-Law” as an area of interest during the general application process;
* After matriculation, students may notify their advisor of their intent to participate in the program

To be considered a part of the program, students must meet with the University’s Pre-Law Advisor to complete an entrance interview. The Pre-Law Advisor will be a full-time member of CUW’s faculty with a background in law. The Pre-Law Advisor at the inception of the program will be Dr. Matthew Mac Kelley.

Following successful completion of an entrance interview with the Pre-Law Advisor, students will declare they intend to pursue the Pre-Law Pathway with the Office of the Registrar using the Major Declaration form. (Students will select “Pre-Law” in the drop-down menu in response to the question “Are you a pre-professional student?”) Once declared, students will be assigned an Attribute in Banner which will allow the University to track program participants.

**Academic Policy/Practice Implications**

There are a few policies and practices that would need to be waived or adjusted for students in this partnership:

* Concordia University has the following policy listed within the Admissions, Transfer Credit Policy section of the catalog:

_Students must be ‘in residence’ (i.e., complete at least one course) at CUWAA during the graduation semester. It is recommended that students meet with their academic advisor prior to the final semester to review their degree evaluation and make plans for completion of all remaining program requirements._

This requirement would be waived by the Academic Office for students in this program.

* The process for the graduation application would need to be considered. Students must be active and registered during the term in which they apply for graduation. Students will be completing coursework at Marquette University during the term in which they typically apply, which would require a manual process for students to complete the graduation application. It is suggested the timing and requirement for the graduation application be included and addressed throughout the advising process in years 1-3 of the program.
* CUWAA students are moved to “inactive” status in Banner following three terms without registering for CUWAA courses. Students will be in their third term of non-registration during their final year (senior summer, senior fall, senior spring). A manual process may be needed to ensure students do not become inactive in Banner within this timeframe.

Given the limited anticipated number of program participants, it is recommended that these matters be addressed utilizing manual processes or other procedures that do not require entire systems to be reconfigured.

**Student Advising**

Students in the program must successfully complete all major requirements and core requirements by the end of their junior year. Strong academic advising will be key in allowing students to take advantage of this partnership program.

Students will be assigned a professional academic advisor who is familiar with their chosen degree program. Additionally, students will also be assigned to the Pre-Law advisor. The Pre-Law advisor and professional advisors will outline a Student Educational Plan that allows students to complete 91 credit hours by the end of the student’s junior year at Concordia.

First-year courses are Marquette University are listed on [Marquette’s New Student Orientation webpage](https://law.marquette.edu/prospective-students/new-student-orientation):

Fall semester first year courses are: Criminal Law (3 credits), Torts (4 credits), Contracts (4 credits), and Legal Analysis, Writing and Research 1 (3 credits). A typical fall course schedule will include two classes per day with one in the morning and one in the afternoon with a break during the mid-day. Spring semester first year courses are: Constitutional Law (4 credits), Property (4 credits), Civil Procedure (4 credits), and Legal Analysis, Writing and Research 2 (3 credits).

**Pre-Law Advising**

The role of the Pre-Law advisor will be key in providing adequate support to students as they consider and complete the program. Supportive practices will be developed to provide career counseling and assistance for students as they prepare to complete their application to Marquette University. A SAMPLE document outlining supportive practices from a peer institution can be found here: [3plus3timeline.pdf (snc.edu)](https://www.snc.edu/academics/pre-professional/pre-law/docs/3plus3timeline.pdf)

Concordia’s Pre-Law advising can be further enhanced to include regular opportunities to shadow practicing attorneys in years 1-2, Marquette University admissions sessions at CUW and/or Marquette, participation in symposia and lectures offered on campus at CUW, and regular visits to Marquette University.

**Student Educational Plans**

Law school admission does not require completion of a particular undergraduate degree. Therefore, any program that meets the requirements outlined above is eligible to be utilized as a part of this program.

Programs that have a minimum of 29 free elective credits are good options to begin with when considering the undergraduate major. Programs that have fewer than 29 free electives may still be considered, provided degree requirements could be met by leveraging MU coursework in meeting degree or core requirements. (Example: The proposed PPE major has 26 credits of free elective. A MU course (Constitutional Law) could be substituted to meet the Society and Culture dimension of the core). Possible programs include, but are not limited to: History, Philosophy, Justice and Public Policy, English, Data Science and Mathematics, General Business, and Theology.

SEP’s will be developed in collaboration with the student’s advisor and Pre-Law advisor. A sample SEP for the Justice and Public Policy program is available in Appendix B.

**Website and Marketing Plan**

An overall strategy is being developed within Marketing and Admissions to highlight Pre-Professional programs. This partnership will be a feature in developing a “Pre-Law” feature.

Website plans include a dedicated “Pre-Professional” page which would feature the following:

* Pre-Law
* Pre-Med
* Pre-Dental
* Pre-Seminary
* Pre-Pharmacy (internal)
* Pre Healthcare
  * Pre-PT
  * Pre-OT

Each option listed above would have its own link and individual webpage with information about the program or pathway. A Pre-Professional Pathways logo will be developed to support all of the “Pre” pathways listed above.

For the Pre-Law page, highlights of the partnership would include:

* Savings of time/money by taking one less year to complete Bachelor’s and JD
* Combination of CUW experience and exposure to MU Law School through visits, meetings, and possible mentors
* Dedicated advising through time at CUW including faculty advisor specifically for Pre-Law
* Collaboration between CUW and Marquette
* Clear pathway for students
* Early career start

Cutsheets would also be created to share information about the program as a part of regular recruitment strategies.

Blogposts would be created to highlight the Marquette and other program “Pre” partnerships.

A signing event can be arranged with Marquette for the spring term to celebrate this new partnership. The event could feature a CUW/MU alumni and/or prospective CUW student. Social media content can be generated from the event.
