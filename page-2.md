**(2) mutuality,**&#x20;

**(3) enforceability, and**&#x20;

**(4) degree of completion.**

#### &#x20;<a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

#### Core definition  <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

* **Offer = conditional promise** to do or refrain from doing something in the future.
* Offer is a proposal intended to show **assent to contract terms**.

Key vocabulary:

* **Offeror**: party making the offer.
* **Offeree**: party intended to receive the offer.

#### Required elements of an offer <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

Three elements must exist for a legally effective offer:

1. **Intent** to enter a binding contract
2. **Communication** of the offer
3. **Definiteness** of essential terms

**Intent**&#x20;

* The offer must show the offeror **intentionally assents** to a binding deal.
* **Mutual** assent: offer aims at forming a binding agreement.

Core rule:

* No contract unless the offer is **communicated to the offeree**.
* Offer is not effective until **received** by the offeree. (Same idea applies to revocations and rejections.)

Illustrations from the page:

* **Unsent email**: writing an offer but not sending it means no offer made.
* **Crossed emails**: if both send offers without knowing the other’s offer, there is still no contract until one accepts the other’s offer.
* **Multiple alternative offers**: “I accept your terms” is insufficient if the offeree doesn’t specify which offer.

Key “cut-off” example:

* Offeree says: “I accept on whatever terms you want,” while not hearing the terms. Result: **no contract**.

**Unknown reward offers (unilateral contract concept) (5–7 min)**

* Private reward: must **know** of the offer and perform the task to accept.
* If you return the dog **without knowing** of the reward: **no contractual obligation**.
* Governmental standing rewards may differ by ordinance (knowledge may not be required).
* Partial performance after discovering the offer can preserve a claim (bonus example).

**3C) Definiteness (10–12 min)**

* Offer must state essential terms with enough certainty for enforcement/damages.
* “Law does not make contracts for the parties”; it enforces undertaken duties.

Examples:

* “Such coal as the promisor may wish to sell” is too indefinite. (No duty unless the seller “wishes” to sell.)
* **Essential terms** include **price** and **work to be done**.
* Not every omission is fatal if a missing term can be fixed by an **external standard** (e.g., “no later than the first frost”).

Business context:

* “Agreement in principle” can still create liability even if incomplete. (Pennzoil/Getty example; major consequences.)

Alternatives:

* Offer with **definite alternatives** can be valid.
* Competing interpretations: true alternative contract vs. damages-for-breach framing (non-compete example).

#### 4) Termination of an offer (10–12 min) <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

An offer continues until it:

1. Is **rejected**
2. Is replaced by a **counteroffer**
3. **Lapses/expires**
4. Is **revoked**
5. Is terminated by **operation of law**

Timing rule:

* If no time stated, it stays open for a **reasonable time**.
* **Lapsed offer**: acceptance period expired (expired coupon example).

#### 5) What is not an offer (15 min) <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

Use these as issue-spotting categories:

**5A) Common non-offers (from the page)**

* **Illusory promise**: no duty to perform Example: “If I decide to buy a new car, I’ll give you my old one.”
* **Pre-existing duty**: cannot leverage an existing duty for more Example: charging extra for teaching already paid by tuition.
* **Forbearance of invalid claim**: promising not to sue on a known invalid claim is not a valid offer (Note: page says valid claims may differ.)
* **Past consideration**: promise made after the act is not enforceable as consideration Example: promise to pay $500 two months after house painting.

**5B) Advertisements (8–10 min)**

Default rule:

* Most **advertisements, price quotations, invitations to bid** are not offers. They are invitations for customers to make offers.

Why:

* Often missing terms like **quantity**, **delivery time**, etc. (definiteness).

Examples/phrases signaling “not an offer”:

* “Make me an offer”
* “$800 or best offer” (eBay-style)

Important caveat:

* Under proper circumstances, an advertised statement **can** be construed as an offer (facts matter).

Regulatory overlay discussed:

* FTC “specials” availability rule for retail food stores.
* Many states have similar consumer protection statutes.

#### 6) Application exercises (15–20 min) <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

**Exercise A: Communication & acceptance precision**

Scenario: Seller gives 3 alternative deals; buyer says “I accept.”

* Prompt: Is there a contract? What must be clarified?

**Exercise B: Unknown reward**

Scenario: Finder returns dog without seeing reward notice.

* Prompt: Contractual obligation to pay reward?

**Exercise C: Definiteness**

Scenario: “I’ll sell you as much coal as I want to sell.”

* Prompt: Enforceable offer? Why/why not?

**Exercise D: Ad vs offer**

Scenario: Online ad “Couch $800” vs “Couch $800, first come first served, 3 in stock.”

* Prompt: Which looks more like an offer, and why?

#### 7) Wrap-up (3–5 min) <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

* Offer = **conditional promise** + intent + communication + definiteness.
* If the “offer” isn’t real, acceptance can’t form a contract.
* Offers persist until terminated by the five methods.
