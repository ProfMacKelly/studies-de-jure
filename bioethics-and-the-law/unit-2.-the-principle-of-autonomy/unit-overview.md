# Unit Overview

> And truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the common motives of humanity, and has ventured to trust himself for a taskmaster. High be his heart, faithful his will, clear his sight, that he may in good earnest be doctrine, society, law, to himself, that a simple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to others!

\~ Ralph Waldo Emerson, [_Self-Reliance_](https://emersoncentral.com/ebook/Self-Reliance.pdf)

In [Unit 1](/broken/pages/E2eCwPpxhHwQl8fzt6ff), you were introduced to informed consent through two cases: [_Canterbury v. Spence_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16106013819601769055\&q=Canterbury+v.+Spence+\(1972\)+464+F.2d+772\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50) and [_K.A.C. v. Benson_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16091276977070422572\&q=K.A.C.+v.+Benson,+527+N.W.2d+553+\(Minn.+1995\)\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50). "Autonomy" is derived from the Greek word αυτονομία, meaning "living by one's own laws."\* This essential feature of bioethics and the legal doctrine of informed consent is the entry point for the law’s involvement.

Now, we advance our exploration of autonomy and the doctrine of informed consent, the concept that a patient is the sole decision-maker when it comes to treatment, and in order to decide, must be fully informed. In this week's examination of informed consent, we focus on how it works in practice. In doing so, ask yourself:

* Why do we value autonomy?
* Is informed consent effective?
* What is a physician required to disclose?
* What might the patient want to know? Is the answer the same?

## **About This Unit**

The doctrine of informed consent wasn’t always recognized in the law. Though autonomy has had a place in legal thought for centuries, informed consent was largely developed by the courts on a case-by-case basis. In [_Canterbury v. Spence_](/broken/pages/58j6L9uTSCVG4IKTitwq), which you read [Unit 1](/broken/pages/E2eCwPpxhHwQl8fzt6ff), the court said that there was no established precedent for the particular issue in that case, specifically, the physician’s duty to disclose.\
In this unit, you will learn how the courts first dealt with the doctrine of informed consent, and how it gradually expanded into a patient having greater authority to make their own medical decisions.

## **Learning Objectives**

1. Summarize the meaning and evolution of the doctrine of informed consent as explained by the courts.
2. Analyze the concerns, motivation, and legal reasoning of the judges when deciding these cases.
3. Evaluate autonomy and informed consent in light of the Christian understanding of life, death, and who we are as beings created in the image of God.
