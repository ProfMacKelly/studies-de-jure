# Unit Overview

> The concurrence of the will, when it has its choice either to do or avoid the act in question, \[is] the only thing that renders human actions praiseworthy or culpable.

\~ William Blackstone, _Commentaries on the Laws of England_, [Book IV, Ch. 2, para. 2](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/sharswood-commentaries-on-the-laws-of-england-in-four-books-vol-2).

> The very considerations which judges most rarely mention...are the secret root from which the law draws all the juices of life. I mean, of course, considerations of what is expedient for the community concerned. Every important principle which is developed by litigation is in fact and at bottom the result of more or less definitely understood views of public policy... .

> The power, then, that parents have over their children, arises from that duty which is incumbent on them, to take care of their offspring, during the imperfect state of childhood. To inform the mind, and govern the actions of their yet ignorant nonage, till reason shall take its place, and ease them of that trouble, is what children want, and the parents are bound to.

\~ John Locke, _Second Treatise on Government_, [Ch. VI, Sec. 58](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7370/7370-h/7370-h.htm#CHAPTER_VI).

We have observed in previous weeks how the law attempts to reinforce the ideal of individual autonomy by deferring to the patient's decisions about his or her medical care. But that ideal of autonomy presumes that there is a decision-maker whose own goals, values, and beliefs determine life choices. In other words, the patient must be free from coercion and possess "capacity": the ability to understand the consequences of a particular choice. A person without capacity cannot—legally, at least—make an autonomous choice. Decisionmakers without freedom and capacity will not be held responsible for their decisions, but their decisions will not be enforced. Rather, the law attempts to protect non-autonomous patients from the consequences of their acts. This is done by making determinations—based on various levels and types of impairments—of whether patients are competent or not, as well as determinations of who should decide when a patient cannot.

## **About This Unit**

This unit examines the meaning of competence and how it is determined by doctors and by courts. We also consider the issue of competence at different stages in a person's life: formerly competent patients (such as those with dementia); patients with future competence (i.e., children); and patients with no former competence and no hope of any future competence (e.g., adults with lifelong severe mental retardation).

In these cases, where the problem of deciding for others arises, the main question in focus is: Who should decide? Yet under the surface, another important question is present and must be addressed: what decision-making standard should govern making a substituted judgment about what the patient would want under the circumstances, or making it based on the best interests of the patient, regardless of the patient's preferences?

## **Learning Objectives**

1. Distinguish between "impaired" and "incompetent," and evaluate how courts place patients into either of these categories.
2. Generate a list of factors to be used in making a decision (a) about whether a patient is competent, and (b) who is the best person to make a decision for an incompetent patient.
3. Apply the Christian worldview to improve determinations of competence and substituted decision-making.
