# Unit Overview

> Man cannot dispose over himself because he is not a thing; ...a person cannot be property and so cannot be a thing which can be owned, for it is impossible to be a person and a thing, the proprietor and the property.

_\~_ Immanuel Kant, _Lectures on Ethics,_ [p. 165](https://archive.org/details/aestheticsproble0000bear_g3l8/page/164/mode/2up)

> _Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign._

> "No, it's mine honestly. I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it. I earned it, and I don't think you'll blame me, for I only sold what was my own."

> "Well, I was wild to do something for Father," replied Jo. \[...] "I hate to borrow as much as Mother does, \[...] and was bound to have some money, if I sold the nose off my face to get it."

> "I hadn't the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I went along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I'd like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself. In a barber's window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one black tail, not so thick as mine, was forty dollars. It came to me all of a sudden that I had one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give for mine."

In this unit, we consider the human body—and specifically all of its parts and functions—as commodities that may be transferred to others. These transfers may be intentional and nonconsensual, gratuitous or for-profit, made during life or after death. The transfer may occur in the context of prostitution, slavery and trafficking, blood donation, or merely the gift of a lock of hair.\
Whatever the scenario, there is no doubt that the body has been—and continues to be—commodified in our culture.

In the United States, one cannot legally sell a kidney, bone marrow, blood, or even the nose of her face.\
Prostitution is legal only in Nevada; several states have banned surrogacy contracts; and bans on the sale of genetic material (such as a mother's ova) are virtually nonexistent.

Thus, we consider whether the law can, or should, prohibit any or all of these transactions, as well as when the state should defer to an individual's decisions about her body or instead limit (or coerce) individual choice.

## **About This Unit**

This unit examines the commodification of the human body. The possible "uses" of the body continually expand. Organ transplantation permits some patients to live who would otherwise die; reproductive technology enables the infertile to use the reproductive material and services of others; and medical research proposes to use cells and tissues for new treatments of presently incurable disorders.

But, the law struggles to manage these difficult and controversial new issues. Clear guidance is rare, particularly when the courts consider the competing interests of the humans involved. Is the body property? If so, whose? Does one human owe a duty to another to transfer body parts- either during life or after? Should consent ever be presumed or even mandated?

## **Learning Objectives**

1. Evaluate the ethical distinctions between the different types of transactions in body parts, e.g., donation of bone marrow to help a family member vs. prostitution to pay the bills, etc.
2. Critique the view of the body as one's own "property" and defend the view of the body as a gift over which one is a steward.
3. Build a cogent case—relying on Biblical as well as secular arguments—explaining when transfer of body parts ought to be permitted and justifying when transfers ought to be restricted.
