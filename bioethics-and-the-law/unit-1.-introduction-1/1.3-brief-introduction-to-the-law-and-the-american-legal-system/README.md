# 1.3 Brief Introduction to the Law & the American Legal System

Everyone is responsible for being aware of the laws and regulations affecting their professions, including both federal law and the state in which they practice or otherwise work. If allegations are made regarding someone's professional conduct or provision of care and services, the excuse “I did not know” does not hold up in a court of law or state agency licensing and regulatory board (e.g., a state’s Board of Nursing, Medical Examining Board, etc.). This section will provide some basic legal concepts and an overview of the American Legal System.
