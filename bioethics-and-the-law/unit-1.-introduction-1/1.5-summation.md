# 1.5 Summation

In this unit, you learned the basics of the American legal system, legal thinking, and reading and analyzing case law. Also, you have introduced yourself to a few foundational principles in this course, including a person's autonomy over decisions about their body and the doctrine of informed consent.<br>

In the [next unit](/broken/pages/N7mSdVnYnOnjCMdkUHAf), you will further explore autonomy and informed consent. As you do, ask yourself:

* Why is this doctrine so important?
* Why is autonomy a fundamental issue in every bioethics case (regardless of the specific topic, like abortion, organ donation, or euthanasia)?
* How might a Christian view relationship autonomy and informed consent?
