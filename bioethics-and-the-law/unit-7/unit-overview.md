One of the most prominent issues in the relationship between bioethics and law involves a tripartite conflict involving three other relationships:&#x20;

1. the relationship between the pregnant woman and the developing fetus, commonly referred to as the **maternal-fetal conflict**;&#x20;
2. the relationship between the government's interest in protecting the pregnant woman's life and personal autonomy; and
3. the relationship between the government's interest in protecting the fetus.

**Notes:**

Although fetal terminology (e.g., fetus and fetal development) relates to a stage of prenatal development [distinct from](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] the embryo and embryonic development, these will be referred to collectively using fetal terminology.

The "maternal-fetal" relationship—which includes abortion— have been prominent bioethical issues. Though debated for years, abortion captured national attention with the U.S. Supreme Court cases _Roe v. Wade_ in 1973 and _Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey_ in 1992. Since then, legal challenges have addressed reproduction and birth in increasingly complex and controversial ways.

The law surrounding [**maternal-fetal conflict**](unit-overview.md#about-this-unit)continues to dominate the public's attention. In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued another landmark ruling— _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_—which overturned the precedent established in both _Roe v. Wade_ and _Casey,_ each of which identified a woman's decision about whether to terminate her pregnancy as part of one's bundle of constitutional liberty interests that are considered fundamental.

## **About This Unit**

This unit examines some of the issues in **maternal-fetal conflict**. This term refers to circumstances in which the interests of a pregnant woman and the fetus are "[incompatible with, or in competition with, each other.](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]" This can take different forms, including: &#x20;

* Behavioral choices (e.g., terminating an unwanted pregnancy or lifestyle choices, such as alcohol consumption, smoking, drinking alcohol, etc.);
* Refusal of medical procedures and treatment for the woman or the fetus;&#x20;
* Medical conditions (regardless of treatment or non-treatment, such as cancer); and
* Biological competition for resources or other biological conflicts between the woman and the fetus.\[fn][^3]&#x20;

Whether considered morally, religiously, biologically, medically, and/or legally, the nature of the unborn raises questions about whether—or to what extent—restrictions on a mother's decision-making rights can be justified.

## **Learning Objectives**

1. Discern the importance of understanding how the status of the unborn can and/or should affect the way our laws address the "maternal-fetal conflict" and justify protections of the unborn.
2. Critique the prevailing legal arguments supporting abortions performed by physicians.
3. Build a cogent case—relying on Biblical as well as secular arguments—defending both the regulation (which may include prohibition) and prohibition of abortion and the appropriateness of state intervention to protect the unborn.
