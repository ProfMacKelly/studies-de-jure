Court of Appeals of Michigan

**State of Michigan**\
**v.**\
**Jack Kevorkian**

\[...]

WHITBECK, Judge.

A jury convicted defendant of second-degree murder[\[1\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[1]) and delivering a controlled substance.[\[2\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[2]) The trial court sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of ten to twenty-five years for the murder conviction and seven years for the controlled substance conviction. Defendant appeals as of right and we affirm.

## I. Overview

This case is about death; in particular, the death of former racecar driver Thomas Youk in September 1998. Youk was fifty-two years old and had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Defendant twice videotaped himself interacting with Youk. In the first videotape, defendant went to Youk's home to discuss his condition. In the second videotape, defendant administered a lethal drug to Youk. Defendant later was a guest on the television news show _60 Minutes,_ during which segments from both videotapes were shown. The jury saw the videotapes and the _60 Minutes_ interview at defendant's trial. Nevertheless, defendant attempted to persuade the jury not to convict him because the murder he was charged with committing was, in his view, a "mercy killing."

Given this factual setting, this appeal presents a fascinating paradox. Though he made an impassioned plea to the jury to adopt his views on euthanasia, in this appeal defendant has given almost no attention to his claim that this homicide had a legal justification or excuse. Indeed, exactly seven of the fifty pages in his brief to this Court address euthanasia. Even during oral arguments, defendant's appellate counsel made not a single reference to this issue.

Nevertheless, euthanasia is at the core of this case. But for defendant's selfdescribed zealotry, Thomas Youk's death would, in all probability, not have been the subject of national attention, much less a murder trial. Defendant, in what is now apparently something of an afterthought, asks us to conclude that euthanasia is legal and, therefore, to reverse his conviction on constitutional grounds. We refuse. Such a holding would be the first step down a very steep and very slippery slope. To paraphrase the United States Supreme Court in [_Washington v. Glucksberg_](washington-v.-glucksberg.md)_,_[\[3\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[3]) it would expand the right to privacy to include a right to commit euthanasia and thus place the issue outside the arenas of public debate and legislative action. Such a holding would also involve the judiciary in deciding questions that are simply beyond our capacity. Succinctly put, there is no principled basis for us to legalize euthanasia.

Defendant's other issues are more mundane and we describe the relevant facts in more detail in the appropriate discussion sections. First, defendant asserts that his trial attorney, David Gorosh, did not provide him with his constitutional right to effective representation. However, defendant has failed to demonstrate that Gorosh performed deficiently at any time he actually acted as counsel. Defendant also failed to prove that Gorosh, while acting as standby counsel, took control of the case or did anything to destroy the jury's perception that defendant was representing himself. Even assuming for the sake of argument that a claim alleging ineffective assistance of standby counsel is legally cognizable, defendant still has not proved that Gorosh acted deficiently and prejudicially. Defendant chose—almost certainly unwisely but nevertheless knowingly, intelligently, voluntarily, and unequivocally—to represent himself. He cannot now assign the blame for his conviction to someone who did not act as his trial counsel.

Second, defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly referred to defendant's decision to exercise his right to remain silent, thereby denying him his rights under the Fifth Amendment. The remarks at issue were the prosecutor's proper objections to defendant's repeated and improper attempts to inject into his closing argument facts that were not in evidence. As such, the prosecutor's remarks were not direct and unequivocal references to defendant's failure to testify, and therefore, the making of those remarks did not constitute misconduct.

Third, defendant claims that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of Terrence and Melody Youk, Thomas' brother and sister-in-law. However, defendant misreads the applicable standards with respect to res gestae witnesses and then fails entirely to demonstrate how the proposed testimony would have been relevant. Thus, even on this narrow evidentiary issue, defendant's arguments have no merit.

## II. The Death Of Thomas Youk

### A. The September 15, 1998, Videotape

On September 15, 1998, at 9:55 p.m., defendant went to Youk's home to discuss Youk's condition. As the videotape of this discussion revealed, defendant stated that he was recording their interaction in "connection with a request from Thomas \[Youk] for help in ... ending his suffering." Youk then described his condition. He recalled that his symptoms of ALS first became obvious to him in 1994 and that he had been confined to a wheelchair since 1997. By September 1998, Youk said, he could not move his left arm or his legs, he had minimal use of his right arm, he had difficulty swallowing and breathing, he was fed through a tube, and he was forced to use a machine to help him breathe. Youk stated that, at the time, he could not do anything for himself, that he had discussed "his wishes" with his mother, brothers, and wife, and that they "understand why. It's my decision."

Defendant then told Youk that he needed to sign a form indicating that he was consenting to a "direct injection instead of using the device, the machine." Defendant asked Youk if he wished to donate his organs, and Youk declined. Defendant then read the consent form, which stated in part:

> I, Thomas Youk, the undersigned, entirely voluntarily, without any reservation, external persuasion, pressure, or duress, and after prolonged and thorough deliberation, hereby consent to the following medical procedure of my own choosing, and that you have chosen direct injection, or what they call active euthanasia, to be administered by a competent medical professional, in order to end with certainty my intolerable and hopelessly incurable suffering.

The meeting ended at 10:15 p.m.

### B. The September 16, 1998, Videotape

On September 16, 1998, at 9:49 p.m., defendant again videotaped himself and Youk at Youk's home. Youk stated that he "wanted to go through with this" and signed the consent form. Defendant remarked that he would inject Youk in the vein because "it's quicker," and stated, "now I'm going to put on a cardiogram so we know when your heart is stopped, okay." Defendant established a connection between Youk and the electrocardiogram. Defendant injected Youk with Anectine and Seconal before injecting Youk with potassium chloride. During this time, defendant provided a commentary on what was occurring:

> Sleepy Tom? Tom are you asleep? And now we'll inject the Anectine. You asleep Tom? Tom? You asleep? He's asleep. Now the Potassium Chloride. This machine is recording for some reason so I'm pulling it by hand until the heart stops. It's been, it's been about two minutes since I injected the, ah, seconal, and one minute since I injected the—. Now we're getting agonal complexes and that's about the, the Potassium Chloride will stop the heart, so. Now there's a straight line. A straight line and the cardiogram will be turned off. His heart is stopped.

### C. Cause Of Death

The police were dispatched to Youk's house on September 17, 1998, at 1:30 a.m. They found Youk lying on his bed, dead. The police also found a Federal Express receipt with defendant's name at the scene. Officials conducted Youk's autopsy at 10:00 a.m. the same day. The medical examiner listed the manner of death as homicide and the cause of death as intravenous injection of substances. During the autopsy, the medical examiner found two "fresh" needle marks on Youk's left and right wrists that had been covered with makeup. The autopsy protocol stated that the cause of death was "poisoning by intravenous injection of substances."

Oakland County Medical Examiner Ljubisa J. Dragovic, an expert in neuropathology and pathology who later testified for the prosecution at defendant's trial, witnessed the autopsy. Dr. Dragovic found three significant drugs in Youk's bodily fluids. First, Youk had a high level of the barbiturate Seconal, also known as Secobarbital, in his blood. Seconal is a Schedule 2 controlled substance[\[4\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[4]) typically used to induce sleep. Dr. Dragovic believed that the amount of Seconal in Youk's blood would have killed him in a few hours. Second, Dr. Dragovic found Anectine, a paralyzing muscle relaxant, present in Youk's body in an amount that could have killed Youk within five to eight minutes by causing brain death. However, Dr. Dragovic determined that it was the third drug, potassium chloride, that defendant injected into Youk that caused his death. As Dr. Dragovic explained, when potassium chloride is injected into the body in a concentrated form at once, rather than in small amounts over time, it stops the heart from beating within a matter of seconds. According to Dr. Dragovic, the toxicology reports did not reveal the presence of potassium chloride in Youk's body because that substance is naturally present in the body after red blood cells die.

Dr. Dragovic also confirmed that Youk had ALS. However, in Dr. Dragovic's opinion, Youk did not die from ALS, ALS was not an underlying cause of Youk's death, and ALS did not contribute to Youk's death in any way. Rather, Dr. Dragovic firmly reiterated that the poisons injected into Youk killed him, constituting a homicide.

### D. The _60 Minutes_ Interview

News correspondent Mike Wallace interviewed defendant for _60 Minutes._ In the first clip from the interview shown to the jury, Wallace stated at the outset, "You killed him." Defendant responded: "I did, but it could be Manslaughter not Murder. It's not necessarily Murder. But it doesn't bother me what you call it. I know what it is. This could never be a crime in any society which deems itself enlightened." Defendant indicated that he was making an example of Youk. Wallace then suggested that Youk was initially a little reluctant because Youk "thought he was getting assisted suicide." Defendant replied that "this is better than assisted suicide, I explained that to him. It's better control."

Defendant also explained to Wallace the process leading to Youk's death. According to defendant, the first injection paralyzed Youk's muscles and slowed his ability to take in oxygen. When the oxygen was "cut off" and Youk could not breathe, defendant injected the "potassium chloride to stop the heart." Defendant then told Wallace that "\[e]ither they go or I go," apparently meaning that he would be acquitted for killing Youk or, if convicted, he would starve to death in prison. As defendant put it: "I've got to force them to act. They must charge me. Because if they do not, that means they don't think it's a crime. Because they don't need any more evidence do they? Do you have to dust for fingerprints on this\[?]"

Wallace suggested that defendant was "engaged in a political, medical, macabre... publicity venture," and had a "ghoulish... desire to see the deed done." Defendant did not disagree with those assertions, stating: "Well, it could be, I, I can't argue with that. Maybe it is ghoulish. I don't know. It appears that way to you. I can't criticize you for that." In fact, defendant agreed with Wallace, emphasizing that "the main point is ... that the deed be done." Evidently in response to the argument that legalizing euthanasia could be problematic in practice, defendant commented that "\[e]verything can be abused. You learn from abuse, you punish the abuser, and then ... if you want to control, you say that only certain doctors can do this in certain areas, nobody else.... That's the way to control it."

Defendant then returned to one of his main themes, saying:

> _Defendant_]: If you don't have liberty and self-determination, you got nothing. That's what this country's built on and this is the ultimate self-determination to determine when and how you're gonna die when you're suffering.
>
> \[_Wallace_]: And those who say that \[defendant], Dr. Death, is a fanatic?
>
> \[_Defendant_]: Zealot. No, not if, sure, you try to take a liberty away and I turn fanatic.... I'm fighting for me, Mike, me. This is a right I want when I, I'm 71, I'll be 71. You don't know what'll happen when you get older. I may end up terribly suffering. I want some colleague to be free to come and help me when I say the time has come. That's why I'm fighting for, me. Now that sounds selfish. And if it helps everybody else, so be it.

## III. Euthanasia And The Constitution

### A. Facts And Argument

Before trial, defendant, relying on the Ninth Amendment,[\[5\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[5]) filed a motion asking the trial court to dismiss the charges against him. Evidently, defendant intended to argue that the people had retained the right to active euthanasia. The trial court denied the motion on the grounds that it was untimely and that defendant had failed to cite any support for his argument. Defendant then filed an emergency application for leave to appeal the trial court's order with this Court. In addition to challenging the trial court's ruling, he also claimed that the prosecution violated the Michigan constitutional counterpart to the Ninth Amendment.[\[6\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[6]) This Court ultimately determined that defendant failed to articulate the need for immediate appellate review.[\[7\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[7])

On appeal, defendant makes two related, but separate, constitutional arguments. First, he argues that the unenumerated rights protected by the Ninth Amendment and its Michigan constitutional counterpart[\[8\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[8]) include a patient's right to be free from unbearable pain and suffering. Second, he maintains that the Fourteenth Amendment[\[9\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[9]) and its Michigan constitutional counterpart[\[10\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[10]) also include this right by proscribing state deprivation of liberty without due process of law either under constitutional privacy concepts or as a "necessary and direct corollary of this position... that a person should not be forced to suffer unbearably." Defendant claims that he has standing to raise these due process arguments. Defendant thus contends that he is entitled to have his murder conviction reversed and no further criminal proceedings instituted against him for "aiding in Thomas Youk's assertion of his constitutional right to be free from intolerable pain and suffering."

\[...]

### C. Constitutional Provisions

\[...]

The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution states, in relevant part, that no state shall "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."[\[15\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[15]) The counterpart provision in the Michigan Constitution states, in relevant part, that "\[n]o person shall be ... deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law."[\[16\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[16])

### D. The Nature Of Defendant's Arguments

At the outset it is important to understand the nature of defendant's constitutional claims. The best way to do this is to state clearly the constitutional arguments that defendant does _not_ raise.

First, defendant does _not_ ask us to hold that he acted properly in furtherance of the right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment. In [_Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep't of Health_](cruzan-v.-director-missouri-dept.-of-health/)_,_[\[17\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[17]) the United States Supreme Court "assume\[d] that the United States Constitution would grant a competent person a constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition," likely under a Fourteenth Amendment due process liberty interest analysis.[\[18\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[18]) More recently, in [_Glucksberg_](washington-v.-glucksberg.md)_,_[\[19\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[19]) the Court strengthened the constitutional basis for the _Cruzan_ decision, interpreting _Cruzan_ as holding that "the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment was so rooted in our history, tradition, and practice as to require special protection under the Fourteenth Amendment." \[...][^1] The limited scope of these cases \[i.e., removal of life support] does not establish a right to be free from unbearable pain and suffering that would make euthanasia legal. There is, of course, a substantial factual distinction between refusing care, even if doing so hastens death, and purposefully ending a life.

Second, defendant does _not_ make any claim that this case concerns medical efforts to relieve pain or discomfort, though these medical efforts may hasten death. Michigan exempts such medical efforts from criminal penalties.[\[21\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[21]) Importantly, however, the exemption does not apply to medical efforts designed to _cause_ death.[\[22\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[22]) \[...][^2]

Third, defendant does _not_ ask us to find that his actions in this matter constituted some form of permissible assisted suicide. In Michigan, assisting in a suicide—that is, providing the physical means by which another person attempts or commits suicide or participating in a physical act by which another person attempts or commits suicide—is illegal.[\[24\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[24])&#x20;

\[...]

\[D]efendant makes no attempt to assert that he was engaged in assisted suicide when he injected Youk with potassium chloride, causing his death. Rather, he \[...] asserts that the right to be free from unbearable pain and suffering caused by a medical condition is inherently part of the liberty interests secured by the Fourteenth Amendment and its Michigan counterpart. \[...][^3]

\[...][^4] In a nutshell, and using his own terminology, **defendant asks us to legalize euthanasia**.

\[...]

### F. Euthanasia As A Due Process Right To Privacy

#### (1) Defendant's Argument

Defendant \[proposes] that there is a right to privacy that is part of the liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and its Michigan counterpart. He then asserts that the "intensely personal and private right of a patient to be free from intolerable and irremediable suffering" is either part of or similar to this privacy right. Citing [_Vacco_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10644975876581235704\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50)_,_ he argues that if the administration of aggressive painkilling drugs is acceptable even if this may hasten death, then the "necessary and direct corollary of this position is that a person should not be forced to suffer unbearably."

#### (2) Encompassing Euthanasia Within The Right To Privacy

It is one thing to assert, as defendant does, that there is a large body of case law suggesting that due process sometimes relies on the right to privacy to protect fundamental liberty interests.[\[34\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[34]) It is quite another thing, however, to conclude that the right to privacy encompasses euthanasia. As Justice Jackson once pointedly noted, the enduring nature of precedent gives judicial opinions a force all their own. \[...][^5][\[35\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[35])

Defendant urges us to \[expand the precedential strength] of the right to privacy cases. He asks us to use this \[...] to resolve the situation faced by a person who suffers from literally unbearable pain and who wishes to end that pain by dying. As Justice O'Connor described it: "Death will be different for each of us. For many, the last days will be spent in physical pain and perhaps the despair that accompanies physical deterioration and a loss of control of basic bodily and mental functions."[\[37\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[37])

We decline, however, to \[use expand precedent this way] for three basic reasons. First, we can find no meaningful precedent for expanding the right to privacy to include a right to commit euthanasia so that an individual can be free from intolerable and irremediable suffering. To our knowledge, no court of last resort in this country has ever recognized such a right. Even in the assisted suicide cases dealing with an asserted "right to die," courts have steadfastly refused to expand the right to privacy to include the right to commit or receive euthanasia. \[...] &#x20;

\[The United States Supreme Court] determined that a state has legitimate and countervailing interests in preserving life,[\[40\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[40]) preventing suicide,[\[41\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[41]) protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession, protecting vulnerable groups from abuse, neglect, and mistakes,[\[42\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[42]) and acknowledging the equal value of all people.[\[43\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[43]) Most importantly, the _Glucksberg_ majority noted that states "may fear that permitting assisted suicide will start it down the path to voluntary and perhaps even involuntary euthanasia."[\[44\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[44]) Here, expanding the right to privacy would begin, as the steps in the progression of defendant's argument supporting voluntary euthanasia clearly indicate, the slide down the slippery slope toward euthanasia. \[...]

Second, we conclude that by expanding the right to privacy as defendant suggests, we would, to a great extent, place the matter outside the arenas of public debate and legislative action.[\[51\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[51]) Whatever the life experiences or the policy preferences of the members of this Court might be, we must exercise the utmost care to assure, when asked to break new ground, that the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment not be subtly transformed into an expression of personal belief rather than an adherence to the rule of law.[\[52\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[52]) If society is to recognize a right to be free from intolerable and irremediable suffering, it should do so through the action of the majority of the legislature, whose role it is to set social policy,[\[53\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[53]) or by action of the people through ballot initiative. \[...]

Third, we observe that by expanding the right of privacy to include a right to commit euthanasia in order to end intolerable and irremediable suffering we would inevitably involve the judiciary in deciding questions that are simply beyond its capacity. There is no court that can answer the question of how _much_ pain, or perception of pain by a third party, is necessary before the suffering becomes intolerable and irremediable. The role of the courts is to serve neither as physicians nor as theologians. \[...]&#x20;

Though other jurisdictions may not value all life equally, that is not true in Michigan.[\[56\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[56]) In a state that constitutionally prohibits putting to death the convicted perpetrator of even the most heinous of crimes,[\[57\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[57]) courts are simply unsuited to make that decision with respect to the innocent. No judge, no matter how learned, can assess the quality of human life and determine, as a matter of law, that putting an end to suffering is justifiable in one case while in another case it is not. This sort of subjective determination would be unavoidable if we begin, through judicial intervention, to decide who shall live and who shall die.

Rather, the role of the courts is to apply the rule of law. As Chief Justice Burger once eloquently explained: "It is often observed that hard cases make bad law. I suspect there is some truth to that adage, for the "hard" cases always tempt judges to exceed the limits of their authority ... to reach a "desirable" result. Cardozo no doubt had this type of case in mind when he wrote:

> The judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly free. He is not to innovate at pleasure. He is not a knight errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness. He is to draw his inspiration from consecrated principles. He is not to yield to spasmodic sentiment, to vague and unregulated benevolence. He is to exercise a discretion informed by tradition, methodized by analogy, disciplined by system, and subordinated to \`the primordial necessity of order in the social life.' Wide enough in all conscience is the field of discretion that remains. [_The Nature of the Judicial Process_](#user-content-fn-6)[^6], 141 (1921).

\[As Chief Justice Burger further explained:]

> What Cardozo tells us is beware the "good result," achieved by judicially unauthorized or intellectually dishonest means on the appealing notion that the desirable ends justify the improper judicial means. For there is always the danger that the seeds of precedent sown by good men for the best of motives will yield a rich harvest of unprincipled acts of others also aiming at "good ends."[\[58\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[58])

Simply put, the courts are not free to create new rights out of whole cloth. We will not do so here.

### G. Conclusion

We conclude by noting that the jury, no doubt influenced by the gritty realism of the videotapes defendant made as well as his flat statement of culpability in the _60 Minutes_ interview, convicted defendant of second-degree murder as well as delivery of a controlled substance. Defendant has on the record before us compared himself to Margaret Sanger, Susan B. Anthony, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., all of whom risked imprisonment for their beliefs. How history will view defendant is a matter this Court can neither predict nor decide. Perhaps in the brave new world of defendant's "enlightened" society, acts such as the one he committed in this case will be excused. Still, we find it difficult to hypothesize a rule of law under which this might be so.

We deal here, however, with the application of the law as it currently exists to the facts of this case. While defendant has carefully skirted the label of murder in his past actions, he cannot do so now. Justice Levin once stated that "\[defendant] is not a murderer."[\[78\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[78]) Here, defendant in essence convicted himself of a murder he surely committed. We will not now reverse that conviction on due process grounds. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to dismiss the charges.

[^1]: Here, defendant does not, and could not, rely on _Cruzan;_ factually, this case does not involve removing life support. Further, though not resting their decisions precisely on the Fourteenth Amendment, Michigan courts have arrived at the same conclusion regarding a patient's right to refuse life-sustaining medical care.[\[20\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[20])&#x20;

[^2]: 

    Factually, there is not a scintilla of evidence that defendant administered potassium chloride to Youk to relieve Youk's pain or discomfort. Defendant admits as much in his brief on appeal:

    "The only medical relief for Thomas Youk's conditions was the relief that he sought from \[defendant]. The injection \[defendant] gave to Thomas Youk was the only effective medical way to alleviate Thomas Youk's unbearable suffering. _No pain medication would suffice, and there was no other beneficial medical alternative that would have aided Thomas Youk."_[\[23\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[23])

[^3]: Defendant then contends that he cannot be prosecuted for "aiding in Thomas Youk's assertion of his constitutional right to be free from intolerable pain and suffering." Although defendant's appellate counsel has carefully avoided using the words, as we have already noted, the record indicates that defendant was quite specific when describing his actions; he said he was engaged in "active euthanasia" and the consent form that Youk signed directly refers to such active euthanasia.

[^4]: In summary, defendant does not, nor could he, ask us to hold that his actions were legally justifiable because he simply helped Youk exercise his right to refuse medical care. Defendant does not, nor could he, ask us to hold that he was lawfully attempting to alleviate Youk's pain and suffering by any means other than causing his death. Defendant does not, nor could he, ask us to hold that his actions constituted a legal form of assisted suicide.&#x20;

[^5]: The principle then lies about like a loaded weapon.... Every repetition imbeds that principle more deeply in our law and thinking and expands it to new purposes. All who observe the work of courts are familiar with what Judge Cardozo described as "the tendency of a principle to expand itself to the limit of its logic."[\[36\]](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18375464080686811227\&q=639+N.W.2d+291\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#\[36])
