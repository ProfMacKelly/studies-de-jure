In the previous two units, you have examined the principle of autonomy in conventional medical treatment, especially the question of when to end that treatment. In this unit, you encounter the problem of end-of-life decisions and consider the distinction between the withdrawal of medical treatment and assisting a suicide. This shift—both in societal attitudes and in doctors’ participation—moved the legal emphasis from civil law to criminal law, and even to questions of constitutional rights. In this way, the principle of autonomy has been (and continues to be) altered and extended.

## **About This Unit**

This unit examines the extension of autonomy and the gradual march toward euthanasia. The quotations invoke differing manifestations of legal and moral questions about the ending of one's life and self-determination.

The cases you will read consider whether assisted suicide ought to be a crime and whether it ought to be a right. Finally, these cases raise related questions, such as:

* If doctors can provide the means of suicide to their patients, why can’t they administer it themselves?
* If voluntary euthanasia should be legal, what about involuntary euthanasia?

## **Learning Objectives**

1. Discern the distinctions made by the courts when analyzing whether a physician’s assistance in a person’s suicide qualifies as murder.
2. Summarize the evolution of assisted suicide from a crime to a right.
3. Critique the arguments for, and defend the arguments against, collapsing the distinction between assisted suicide and euthanasia.
