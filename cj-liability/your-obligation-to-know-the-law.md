# Your Obligation to Know the Law

In short, employees of the government—including criminal justice professionals, of course—are [**required to know the law**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]; this obligation not only includes the [codified law](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] but also the judicial cases interpreting the codified law. Thus, future and current criminal justice professionals must understand the case law that governs their conduct.

This class is not law school, and it is not about turning students into lawyers. _**But**_ this class may feel like a "mini-law school" because how lawyers think and how criminal justice professionals need to think are not as different as many people might believe (i.e., to be most effective and minimize legal risk to themselves and their employers). Thus, to help understand case law, the course starts with understanding legal reasoning.
