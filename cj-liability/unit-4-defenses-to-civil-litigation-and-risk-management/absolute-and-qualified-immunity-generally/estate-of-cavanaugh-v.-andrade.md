Supreme Court of Wisconsin

**ESTATE OF Donald E. CAVANAUGH et al.**\
**v.**\
**Robert ANDRADE and City of Milwaukee; Gary Allen ZERGOSKI.**

## Opinion

ANN WALSH BRADLEY, J.

The plaintiffs, Estate of Donald Cavanaugh and James Cavanaugh, seek review, and the defendants, City of Milwaukee and police officer Robert Andrade, seek cross-review of a decision of the court of appeals that reversed a judgment against the City and affirmed a judgment against Andrade, which was entered by the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County \[...].[1](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#footnote_1_1) The City and Andrade assert immunity from liability for the injuries and death of Donald Cavanaugh which resulted from a collision with a vehicle being pursued by Andrade during a high-speed chase. Because the City has a ministerial duty to have a written policy for high-speed chases which includes consideration of the severity of the offense, we conclude that the City is not immune from liability. \[...] Further, because Andrade's decisions to initiate and continue the chase were discretionary, we conclude that he is immune from liability. \[...]

{% hint style="info" %}
Above, when the court states, "the City is not immune from liability," it simply means that the City can be exposed to liability; it does not mean that the City is liable. Whether the City was held liable is discussed in the version of [this case provided in Unit 3](/broken/pages/js5E5FUgFdAqRLaPDVBU).

### I. FACTS

The issues in this case arise out of a high-speed pursuit involving Andrade and a vehicle driven by Gary Zergoski. Late in the evening on January 13, 1989, Andrade was approaching the intersection of South 35th Street and West Forest Home Avenue when he observed Zergoski pass several stopped vehicles and speed through a solid red traffic signal controlling the intersection. Andrade turned at the intersection and increased his speed to follow Zergoski.

Andrade activated his emergency lights and siren approximately two blocks later, which caused Zergoski to begin to pull over. However, Zergoski again fled at a high rate of speed and turned onto 39th Street. Approximately six to seven blocks later, Andrade observed Zergoski's vehicle stalled in an intersection. Andrade was able to approach close enough to observe Zergoski's license plate number, which he relayed to the dispatcher. Zergoski restarted his vehicle and again fled at a high rate of speed along West Morgan Avenue, which is a main arterial street within a primarily residential neighborhood.

At the intersection of 60th Street and Morgan, Zergoski went through another red light and collided with a vehicle driven by Donald Cavanaugh. According to witnesses, Zergoski was \[traveling] between 60 and 80 miles per hour approximately two blocks prior to this intersection. Andrade estimated that he was approximately one block away from this collision when it occurred. A witness testified that Andrade was within approximately one-half block of Zergoski's vehicle when it entered the intersection. In all, the pursuit spanned approximately 17 blocks. As a result of the collision, Cavanaugh died after spending five months in a coma.

James Cavanaugh, Donald's father, sued the City, Andrade, and Zergoski, individually and as administrator of Donald's estate \[based on negligence]. The case was ultimately tried to a jury, which found the City 23% negligent with respect to implementation of its high-speed pursuit policy, Andrade 2% negligent with respect to the operation of his vehicle, and Zergoski 75% negligent.

### II. IMMUNITY GENERALLY

The central question presented by this case is whether a municipality and its police officers may be liable for injuries arising out of a high-speed pursuit, where the pursued vehicle collides with a third person. The City and Andrade maintain that the general municipal tort immunity set forth in [Wis. Stat. § 893.80(4)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/893/viii/80/4) \[...] relieves them from liability for any damages resulting from the collision between Zergoski and Cavanaugh. This court most recently summarized the doctrine of governmental immunity in _Kimps v. Hill,_ [200 Wis. 2d 1](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2067654/kimps-v-hill/) (1996). As we stated in that case, "\[t]he test for determining whether a duty is discretionary (and therefore within the scope of immunity) or ministerial (and not so protected) is that the latter is found only when \[the duty] is absolute, certain and imperative, involving merely the performance of a specific task when the law imposes, prescribes and defines the time, mode and occasion for its performance with such certainty that nothing remains for judgment or discretion." [_Id._ at 10-11](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/200/html/0001-01.html#p10) \[...] .

Despite the immunity for discretionary acts of municipalities and its employees set forth in § 893.80(4), Cavanaugh argues that neither the City nor Andrade are immune from liability arising out of a high-speed pursuit based on [Wis. Stat. § 346.03](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/346/i/03). Section 346.03 specifically governs the privileges and duties of drivers of emergency vehicles, Wis. Stat. § 346.03[(1)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/346.03\(1\)),[(5)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/346.03\(5\)).[4](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#footnote_1_4)

This court has not yet had occasion to consider the applicability of the defense of immunity in the context of a high-speed pursuit. We consider this question as applied to the City and Andrade separately under the facts and circumstances of this case.

### III. CITY OF MILWAUKEE

#### A. Immunity

Cavanaugh alleged that the City was negligent because it implemented a high-speed pursuit policy that did not comply with Wis. Stat. § [346.03(6)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/346.03\(6\)). However, if the duty imposed by § 346.03(6) is discretionary, as opposed to ministerial, the City is afforded immunity for its actions pursuant to § 893.80(4). Whether § 346.03(6) creates a discretionary or ministerial duty is a question of law that this court reviews de novo. \[...]

Section 346.03(6) imposes a duty on law enforcement agencies that use emergency vehicles to establish written guidelines for high-speed pursuits:

> Every law enforcement agency which uses authorized emergency vehicles shall provide written guidelines for its officers and employees regarding exceeding speed limits . . . and when otherwise in pursuit of actual or suspected violators. The guidelines shall consider, among other factors, road conditions, density of population, severity of crime and necessity of pursuit by vehicle.

The court of appeals concluded that this statute creates a ministerial duty because law enforcement agencies are required to provide written guidelines which must consider certain factors. _..._

We agree with the court of appeals that while the promulgation of guidelines in general involves a great amount of governmental discretion, § 346.03(6) makes the inclusion of certain parts of the policy promulgation ministerial. _.._. The statute mandates that law enforcement agencies "shall provide written guidelines for its officers" which "shall consider" specific factors. These actions are "absolute, certain and imperative, involving merely the performance of a specific task." _Kimps,_ 200 Wis. 2d at 10. Accordingly, the City is not immune from liability for damages caused by a breach of the ministerial duty set forth in § 346.03(6).

### IV. ANDRADE

#### A. Immunity

We next consider the application of the defense of immunity to Andrade's alleged negligence. Cavanaugh argued at trial that Andrade was negligent in failing to terminate the pursuit and negligent with respect to the operation of his vehicle. Andrade asserts that the decisions to initiate and continue a high-speed pursuit are discretionary in nature and therefore entitled to immunity under § 893.80(4). Cavanaugh argues that even if the decisions to initiate and continue the pursuit are discretionary, and as such, normally entitled to immunity, the defense of immunity is not available when an officer negligently operates his or her vehicle contrary to [Wis. Stat. § 346.03](https://static.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20346.03)(5).

As we noted at the outset, a municipal officer is immune under § 893.80(4) for the performance of discretionary acts. _.._. \[A]n officer's decision to initiate or continue a high-speed chase is a discretionary act entitled to immunity. _..._ Several jurisdictions have recently recognized that an officer's decision to initiate and continue a high-speed chase is discretionary.[11](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#footnote_1_11)

Cavanaugh asserts that under § 346.03(5), discretionary act immunity is; inapplicable if the officer fails to operate his or her vehicle "with due regard under the circumstances for the safety of all persons." We agree with Cavanaugh ... that the failure to meet this standard constitutes negligence. ... However, even assuming Andrade was negligent with respect to the initiation or continuation of the chase, he is immune under § 893.80(4). Inherent in the decision to pursue is the decision to speed. _..._

However, nothing in § 346.03 provides that immunity afforded to the discretionary decision to initiate or continue a pursuit is subsumed by § 346.03(5). Although most states have adopted emergency-vehicle-operations statutes that are substantially similar to § 346.03,[12](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#footnote_1_12) it does not follow that the state's immunity provisions are rendered inapplicable. We note that some jurisdictions have specifically applied provisions of immunity statutes while also recognizing the existence of the statutory equivalent to § 346.03(5).[13](https://static.case.law/wis-2d/202/html/0290-01.html#footnote_1_13) In the absence of an expression of clear legislative intent to abolish discretionary act immunity in the context of § 346.03, we conclude that § 346.03(5) does not preclude the defense of immunity for the discretionary acts of initiating or continuing a high-speed pursuit. _.._.

Our holding that § 893.80(4) provides immunity for an officer's decision to initiate or continue a pursuit does not mean, as suggested by the dissent to this section, that officers are afforded blanket immunity from all liability by virtue of their involvement in a pursuit. We agree with the court of appeals that an officer may be negligent pursuant to § 346.03(5) for failing to physically operate his or her vehicle with due regard for the safety of others.

This distinction between an officer's discretionary decision to initiate and continue a pursuit and the physical operation of the vehicle has been recognized by other jurisdictions interpreting language similar to § 346.03(5). In [_Kelly v. City of Tulsa_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], a son sued the city and police officer for wrongful death of his mother who was killed in a collision with , a vehicle being chased by police. The court in analyzing the duty of due care under the equivalent of § 346.03(5) stated:

> \[W]e find that the duty of due care created by the emergency vehicle statutes applies only to the operation of the emergency vehicle itself. The statutes exempt emergency drivers from certain operational "rules of the road," such as obedience to speed limits, parking restrictions and stop signals. The statutes recognize the public necessity for a fire, ambulance or police vehicle in an emergency situation to be _driven_ unhindered by the traffic rules governing ordinary vehicles. . . . Plaintiffs real objection is to \[the officer's] decision to initiate and continue police pursuit. This is not the consideration addressed by \[the emergency vehicle statutes].

[_Kelly_](#user-content-fn-2)[^2].

In [_Thornton_](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]_,_ similar to this case, a police officer pursued a speeding vehicle which ran stop signs and was driven recklessly until it collided with a third party. The Kansas Supreme Court, interpreting the same language contained in § 346.03(5), explained:

> To extend the "due care" requirement to the _decision_ to chase or to continue the chase and hence make the officer the insurer of the law violator would emasculate the privileges and immunities afforded by \[§ 346.03] and thwart the public policy purpose of the statute. . . . We conclude the "due care" requirement of \[§ 346.03(5)] applies only to the police officer's physical operation of his own vehicle and not to the _decision_ to chase or _continue to chase_ a law violator.

[_Thornton_](#user-content-fn-4)[^4].

In sum, despite the general discretionary act immunity set forth in § 893.80(4), a negligence action may be sustained against an officer involved in a high-speed pursuit on the grounds that he or she breached the duty to operate the vehicle with "due regard under the circumstances" under § 346.03(5). However, the negligent operation under § 346.03(5) does not include the discretionary decisions to initiate or continue a pursuit; such discretionary decisions continue to be afforded immunity under § 893.80(4).
