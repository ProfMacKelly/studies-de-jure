# Illinois v. Perkins

Supreme Court of the United States

**Illinois**&#x20;

**v.**&#x20;

**Lloyd Perkins**

[496 U.S. 292](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/496/292/) (1990)

Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.

An undercover government agent was placed in the cell of respondent Perkins, who was incarcerated on charges unrelated to the subject of the agent’s investigation. Respondent made statements that implicated him in the crime that the agent sought to solve. Respondent claims that the statements should be inadmissible because he had not been given _Miranda_ warnings by the agent. We hold that the statements are admissible. _Miranda_ warnings are not required when the suspect is unaware that he is speaking to a law enforcement officer and gives a voluntary statement.

#### **I**

In November 1984, Richard Stephenson was murdered in a suburb of East St. Louis, Illinois. The murder remained unsolved until March 1986, when one Donald Charlton told police that he had learned about a homicide from a fellow inmate at the Graham Correctional Facility, where Charlton had been serving a sentence for burglary. The fellow inmate was Lloyd Perkins, who is the respondent here. Charlton told police that, while at Graham, he had befriended respondent, who told him in detail about a murder that respondent had committed in East St. Louis. On hearing Charlton’s account, the police recognized details of the Stephenson murder that were not well known, and so they treated Charlton’s story as a credible one.

By the time the police heard Charlton’s account, respondent had been released from Graham, but police traced him to a jail in Montgomery County, Illinois, where he was being held pending trial on a charge of aggravated battery, unrelated to the Stephenson murder. The police wanted to investigate further respondent’s connection to the Stephenson murder, but feared that the use of an eavesdropping device would prove impracticable and unsafe. They decided instead to place an undercover agent in the cellblock with respondent and Charlton. The plan was for Charlton and undercover agent John Parisi to pose as escapees from a work release program who had been arrested in the course of a burglary. Parisi and Charlton were instructed to engage respondent in casual conversation and report anything he said about the Stephenson murder.

Parisi, using the alias “Vito Bianco,” and Charlton, both clothed in jail garb, were placed in the cellblock with respondent at the Montgomery County jail. The cellblock consisted of 12 separate cells that opened onto a common room. Respondent greeted Charlton who, after a brief conversation with respondent, introduced Parisi by his alias. Parisi told respondent that he “wasn’t going to do any more time” and suggested that the three of them escape. Respondent replied that the Montgomery County jail was “rinky-dink” and that they could “break out.” The trio met in respondent’s cell later that evening, after the other inmates were asleep, to refine their plan. Respondent said that his girlfriend could smuggle in a pistol. Charlton said: “Hey, I’m not a murderer, I’m a burglar. That’s your guys’ profession.” After telling Charlton that he would be responsible for any murder that occurred, Parisi asked respondent if he had ever “done” anybody. Respondent said that he had and proceeded to describe at length the events of the Stephenson murder. Parisi and respondent then engaged in some casual conversation before respondent went to sleep. Parisi did not give respondent _Miranda_ warnings before the conversations.

Respondent was charged with the Stephenson murder. Before trial, he moved to suppress the statements made to Parisi in the jail. The trial court granted the motion to suppress, and the State appealed. The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed, holding that _Miranda v. Arizona_ prohibits all undercover contacts with incarcerated suspects that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.

We granted certiorari to decide whether an undercover law enforcement officer must give _Miranda_ warnings to an incarcerated suspect before asking him questions that may elicit an incriminating response. We now reverse.

#### **II**

Conversations between suspects and undercover agents do not implicate the concerns underlying _Miranda._ The essential ingredients of a “police-dominated atmosphere” and compulsion are not present when an incarcerated person speaks freely to someone whom he believes to be a fellow inmate. Coercion is determined from the perspective of the suspect. When a suspect considers himself in the company of cellmates and not officers, the coercive atmosphere is lacking. There is no empirical basis for the assumption that a suspect speaking to those whom he assumes are not officers will feel compelled to speak by the fear of reprisal for remaining silent or in the hope of more lenient treatment should he confess.

It is the premise of _Miranda_ that the danger of coercion results from the interaction of custody and official interrogation. We reject the argument that _Miranda_ warnings are required whenever a suspect is in custody in a technical sense and converses with someone who happens to be a government agent. Questioning by captors, who appear to control the suspect’s fate, may create mutually reinforcing pressures that the Court has assumed will weaken the suspect’s will, but where a suspect does not know that he is conversing with a government agent, these pressures do not exist. The state court here mistakenly assumed that because the suspect was in custody, no undercover questioning could take place. When the suspect has no reason to think that the listeners have official power over him, it should not be assumed that his words are motivated by the reaction he expects from his listeners. “\[W]hen the agent carries neither badge nor gun and wears not ‘police blue,’ but the same prison gray” as the suspect, there is no “_interplay_ between police interrogation and police custody.”

_Miranda_ forbids coercion, not mere strategic deception by taking advantage of a suspect’s misplaced trust in one he supposes to be a fellow prisoner. As we recognized in _Miranda:_ “\[C]onfessions remain a proper element in law enforcement. Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence.” Ploys to mislead a suspect or lull him into a false sense of security that do not rise to the level of compulsion or coercion to speak are not within _Miranda’_&#x73; concerns.

_Miranda_ was not meant to protect suspects from boasting about their criminal activities in front of persons whom they believe to be their cellmates. This case is illustrative. Respondent had no reason to feel that undercover agent Parisi had any legal authority to force him to answer questions or that Parisi could affect respondent’s future treatment. Respondent viewed the cellmate-agent as an equal and showed no hint of being intimidated by the atmosphere of the jail. In recounting the details of the Stephenson murder, respondent was motivated solely by the desire to impress his fellow inmates. He spoke at his own peril.

The tactic employed here to elicit a voluntary confession from a suspect does not violate the Self-Incrimination Clause. This Court’s Sixth Amendment decisions \[] also do not avail respondent. We held in those cases that the government may not use an undercover agent to circumvent the Sixth Amendment right to counsel once a suspect has been charged with the crime. After charges have been filed, the Sixth Amendment prevents the government from interfering with the accused’s right to counsel. In the instant case no charges had been filed on the subject of the interrogation, and our Sixth Amendment precedents are not applicable.

Respondent can seek no help from his argument that a bright-line rule for the application of _Miranda_ is desirable. Law enforcement officers will have little difficulty putting into practice our holding that undercover agents need not give _Miranda_ warnings to incarcerated suspects. The use of undercover agents is a recognized law enforcement technique, often employed in the prison context to detect violence against correctional officials or inmates, as well as for the purposes served here. The interests protected by _Miranda_ are not implicated in these cases, and the warnings are not required to safeguard the constitutional rights of inmates who make voluntary statements to undercover agents.

We hold that an undercover law enforcement officer posing as a fellow inmate need not give _Miranda_ warnings to an incarcerated suspect before asking questions that may elicit an incriminating response. The statements at issue in this case were voluntary, and there is no federal obstacle to their admissibility at trial. We now reverse and remand for proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.

### Justice MARSHALL, dissenting.

This Court clearly and simply stated its holding in _Miranda v. Arizona_: “\[T]he prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.” The Court reaches the contrary conclusion by fashioning an exception to the _Miranda_ rule that applies whenever “an undercover law enforcement officer posing as a fellow inmate … ask\[s] questions that may elicit an incriminating response” from an incarcerated suspect. This exception is inconsistent with the rationale supporting _Miranda_ and allows police officers intentionally to take advantage of suspects unaware of their constitutional rights. I therefore dissent.

The Court does not dispute that the police officer here conducted a custodial interrogation of a criminal suspect. Perkins was incarcerated in county jail during the questioning at issue here; under these circumstances, he was in custody as that term is defined in _Miranda._ While Perkins was confined, an undercover police officer, with the help of a police informant, questioned him about a serious crime. Although the Court does not dispute that Perkins was interrogated, it downplays the nature of the 35-minute questioning by disingenuously referring to it as a “conversatio\[n].” The officer’s narration of the “conversation” at Perkins’ suppression hearing however, reveals that it clearly was an interrogation.

“\[Agent:] You ever do anyone?

“\[Perkins:] Yeah, once in East St. Louis, in a rich white neighborhood.

“Informant: I didn’t know they had any rich white neighborhoods in East St. Louis.

“Perkins: It wasn’t in East St. Louis, it was by a race track in Fairview Heights….

“\[Agent]: You did a guy in Fairview Heights?

“Perkins: Yeah in a rich white section where most of the houses look the same.

“\[Informant]: If all the houses look the same, how did you know you had the right house?

“Perkins: Me and two guys cased the house for about a week. I knew exactly which house, the second house on the left from the corner.

“\[Agent]: How long ago did this happen?

“Perkins: Approximately about two years ago. I got paid $5,000 for that job.

“\[Agent]: How did it go down?

“Perkins: I walked up \[to] this guy\[’s] house with a sawed-off under my trench coat.

“\[Agent]: What type gun\[?]

“Perkins: A .12 gauge Remmington _\[sic]_ Automatic Model 1100 sawed-off.”

The police officer continued the inquiry, asking a series of questions designed to elicit specific information about the victim, the crime scene, the weapon, Perkins’ motive, and his actions during and after the shooting. This interaction was not a “conversation”; Perkins, the officer, and the informant were not equal participants in a free-ranging discussion, with each man offering his views on different topics. Rather, it was an interrogation: Perkins was subjected to express questioning likely to evoke an incriminating response.

Because Perkins was interrogated by police while he was in custody, _Miranda_ required that the officer inform him of his rights. In rejecting that conclusion, the Court finds that “conversations” between undercover agents and suspects are devoid of the coercion inherent in station house interrogations conducted by law enforcement officials who openly represent the State. _Miranda_ was not, however, concerned solely with police _coercion._ It dealt with _any_ police tactics that may operate to compel a suspect in custody to make incriminating statements without full awareness of his constitutional rights. Thus, when a law enforcement agent structures a custodial interrogation so that a suspect feels compelled to reveal incriminating information, he must inform the suspect of his constitutional rights and give him an opportunity to decide whether or not to talk.

The Court’s holding today complicates a previously clear and straightforward doctrine. The Court opines that “\[l]aw enforcement officers will have little difficulty putting into practice our holding that undercover agents need not give _Miranda_ warnings to incarcerated suspects.” Perhaps this prediction is true with respect to fact patterns virtually identical to the one before the Court today. But the outer boundaries of the exception created by the Court are by no means clear. Would _Miranda_ be violated, for instance, if an undercover police officer beat a confession out of a suspect, but the suspect thought the officer was another prisoner who wanted the information for his own purposes?

The Court’s adoption of the “undercover agent” exception to the _Miranda_ rule \[] is necessarily also the adoption of a substantial loophole in our jurisprudence protecting suspects’ Fifth Amendment rights.

I dissent.
