## The Relationship Between Law and Bioethics

### Two Case Illustrations

#### **Dr. Jack Kevorkian**

In 1990, a Michigan pathologist named Jack Kevorkian assisted in the suicide of [Janet Adkins, a  54-year-old teacher from Portland, Oregon, with Alzheimer’s disease](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. In the next eight years, he would assist in roughly 130 suicides. He was convicted of the second-degree murder of one of those patients. The video below provides an overview of the case.

#### **Terri Shiavo**

Also in 1990, a young Florida woman named [Terri Schiavo](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] collapsed in her home, and oxygen to her brain was cut off for several minutes; doctors soon diagnosed her as being in a persistent vegetative state. For the next 15 years, her husband and her parents battled each other in court over whether or not to remove Terri’s feeding tube. The video below provides an overview of the case.

Jack Kevorkian and Terri Schiavo are infamous names, not merely because of the medical issues they represent but because of the law’s involvement with those issues.

This course examines how the law and ethics in medical practices converge. Driven by societal changes, technology advancements, and past medical research controversies, the intertwined relationships between medicine, philosophy, and the law continue to evolve.
