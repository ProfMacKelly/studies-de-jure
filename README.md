_Criminal Procedure Sourcebook_ is an [open educational resource](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], focusing on the balance between the public interest in controlling, investigating, and prosecuting criminal conduct and the private interest of individuals in protecting their reasonable expectation of privacy and protecting against arbitrary government deprivations of liberty and property.

Although this book openly licensed and free to be reused, redistributed, [adapted, and/or remixed](https://help.oercommons.org/support/solutions/articles/42000046860-remix-a-resource), readers should note that the contents are tailored to serve undergraduate students enrolled in Criminal Justice Liability Law at Concordia University Wisconsin. This sourcebook includes both content that (a) I authored, (b) I adapted or remixed, and/or (c) incorporated from other creators in compliance with copyright and licensing regulations and practices.
