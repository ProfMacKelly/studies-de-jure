_Criminal Procedure: A Sourcebook_ is an [open educational resource](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], focusing on the balance between the public interest in controlling, investigating, and prosecuting criminal conduct and the private interest of individuals in protecting their reasonable expectation of privacy and protecting against arbitrary government deprivations of liberty and property.
