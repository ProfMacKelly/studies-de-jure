# 1.1 Preparing to Understand Legal Thinking, Reasoning & Analysis

Legal reasoning skills improve the ability to (1) spot and distinguish between relevant and irrelevant facts and evidence in a particular set of circumstances, and (2) develop the ability to communicate thoughts and arguments clearly and persuasively. And while these skills are important for professionals, they are just as translatable and applicable to everyday life.
