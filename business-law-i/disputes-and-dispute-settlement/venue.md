# Venue

**Venue** is the proper geographic location of the court to hear a case because the place has some connection with the events that give rise to the lawsuit. While multiple courts may have subject matter and personal jurisdiction over a dispute, only a few may be the proper venue. For example, by doing business in Colorado, a company is subject to the jurisdiction of Colorado courts. However, the court in the county where the plaintiff was injured or where the business maintains an office would be the proper court to hear the dispute.
