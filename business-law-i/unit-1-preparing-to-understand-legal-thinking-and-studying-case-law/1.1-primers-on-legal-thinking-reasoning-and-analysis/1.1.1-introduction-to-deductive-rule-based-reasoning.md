# 1.1.1 Introduction to Deductive (Rule-Based) Reasoning

The best place to start is to appreciate that legal reasoning—also referred to as legal analysis—is fundamentally comprised of logic. Whether thinking about criminal procedure (e.g., stop and frisk, arrest, search and seizure, etc.), criminal laws, or the civil liability issues in this course, the courts and criminal justice professionals apply specific methodologies when deciding to act or not to act.

There are different legal reasoning/analysis methods, but professionals most commonly engage in both (1) [**deductive reasoning**](1.1.1-introduction-to-deductive-rule-based-reasoning.md#introduction-to-deductive-reasoning) (i.e., syllogistic reasoning) and (2) [**inductive reasoning**](1.1.1-introduction-to-deductive-rule-based-reasoning.md#introduction-to-inductive-reasoning) (in our context, this is reasoning by analogy).

## Introduction

Most of the analysis you will perform in this class will involve deductive reasoning, which is also called [syllogistic ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]reasoning. What we will see is that deductive reasoning produces [conclusions from a set of established premises (assertions): If A is true and B is true, then C must be true](#user-content-fn-2)[^2].

The syllogism represents a fundamental depiction of the deductive reasoning process in law, which starts with a general assertion or proposition and ends with a specific assertion (i.e., the conclusion). Imagine this approach as a funnel or an [inverted pyramid](#user-content-fn-3)[^3].

## Syllogisms

### Simple Syllogisms

#### A Classic Simple Syllogism

A classic example of deductive reasoning is the "Socrates syllogism":

> **Major Premise:** All men are mortal.
>
> **Minor Premise:** Socrates is a man.
>
> **Conclusion:** Socrates is mortal.

In other words, if all men are mortal, and if Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal. The reasoning starts with a broad premise, and the analysis applies the broad premise to the minor premise to yield the conclusion.

#### Validity and Truth

For a deductive reasoning to be [_valid_](#user-content-fn-4)[^4], it must be compatible with (i.e., justified by) the premises. Also, whether the reasoning is valid is [_unrelated_ ](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]to whether the assertions are accurate. To illustrate, let's revise the previous syllogism:

> **Major Premise:** All men are mortal.
>
> **Minor Premise:** Socrates is a bird.
>
> **Conclusion:** Socrates is mortal.

Although both premises and the conclusion may be true, the syllogism's reasoning is invalid. The premise that Socrates is a bird is incompatible with all men being mortal. On its face, the argument is flawed because the premise that "all men are mortal" cannot be applied to Socrates being a bird, and while birds may be mortal, no premise in the syllogism supports that conclusion.

#### Beware of Flawed Arguments Due to Logical Errors in Syllogisms

Some writers or speakers make syllogistic arguments. For instance:

> **Rule:** Some writers or speakers make syllogistic arguments.
>
> **Fact:** Matt is a writer.
>
> **Conclusion:** Therefore, Matt made a syllogistic argument.

The conclusion is based on a logical error because the syllogism lacks facts to determine whether Matt falls within the class of "some." Some logical flaws can be [more subtle](#user-content-fn-5)[^5]:

> **Rule:** All superheroes have special powers.
>
> **Fact:** Superman has special powers.
>
> **Conclusion:** Superman is a superhero.

As opposed to the "some writers or speakers" example above, this rule applies to an entire class. [However, like the "some writers or speakers" example, each part of this syllogism being correct](#user-content-fn-6)[^6] is completely irrelevant to whether the logic is legitimate; _this syllogism is flawed_. Stating that all superheroes have special powers _does not_ mean that superheroes are the only beings with special powers. So, the premises in this syllogism lack the facts necessary to logically conclude that Superman is a superhero.

In law, the sets of propositions include both:

1. **Rules of law**, which are also known as "legal rules" or "laws of the case," "rules of the case," or simply "rules."
2. **Facts** of the case.

{% hint style="info" %}
* In the law, there are typically two categories of **rules**: (1) **codified** and (2) **case law** (i.e., rules issued by courts in judicial decisions).
  * Codified rules include the text of laws such as constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and government agency and departmental policies (e.g., standard operating procedures).
  * Case law is a type of law written by courts to both interpret codified laws and establish or extend the case law (i.e., [common law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/common_law), which we refer to generally as "cases" "opinions," and "decisions." For instance, the U.S. Supreme Court establishes interpretations of constitutional text (through principles of reasonable suspicion and probable cause, stop and frisk, search and seizure, interrogations, etc.), and regularly extends those principles as further applications of those principles become necessary (e.g., exceptions to the warrant requirement, cell phone searches, blood draws, etc.).
* "**Facts**" refers to a given set of circumstances, such as the situation an officer finds themselves in (e.g., witnessing suspected criminal activity, establishing probable cause to apply for a search warrant, when or how much force to use, the behavior of a suspect or inmate).
{% endhint %}

I**n the legal context**

**If using the rule-based reasoning methodology, the Socrates syllogism would look like this:**

> **Rule: All men are mortal.**
>
> **Facts: Socrates is a man.**
>
> **Analysis leading to the conclusion—which, in law, is referred to as the application of the rule to the facts: Because (1) all men are mortal and (2) Socrates is a man, Socrates must be mortal.**

#### The Legal Simple Syllogism

Moving into the legal context in its plainest form, a legal syllogism in criminal cases [looks like this](#user-content-fn-7)[^7]:

> **Rule (the "formula"):** \[**Doing something**] violates \[**a law**.]
>
> **Fact (the "variable"):** The defendant \[**did something**].
>
> **Analysis to Conclusion:** The defendant violated \[**the law**].

Here is a [legal example](#user-content-fn-8)[^8]:

> **Rule (the "formula"):** Section 999.01 of the East Dakota statutes states, "Whosoever, while legally married, shall go through another marriage ceremony recognized by law, shall be guilty of bigamy.
>
> **Facts (the "variables"):** Allen, while married, went through another marriage ceremony recognized by law.
>
> **Analysis to Conclusion:** Because bigamy going through another marriage ceremony recognized by law while already legally married, having multiple legal marriages makes Allen guilty of bigamy.

Here is a second example:

> **Rule (the "formula"):** A law enforcement officer must give a suspect _Miranda_ warnings before asking questions intended to elicit an incriminating response when the suspect is in custody.
>
> **Facts (the "variables"):** Lucy, a law enforcement officer, arrested Charlie, secured him a patrol car, and drove him to the police station.
>
> **Analysis:** Although Charlie was in custody, the facts do not indicate that Lucy asked Charlie any questions intended to elicit an incriminating response.
>
> **Conclusion:** Therefore, under the circumstances, Lucy was not yet required to give Charlie _Miranda_ warnings.

### Polysyllogisms

Because both legal rules and real-life situations can be complex, the deductive legal reasoning methodology _frequently_ includes multiple premises. These circumstances require a **polysyllogism**—a multi-premise syllogism—[to reach the desired conclusion](#user-content-fn-9)[^9].

**Polysyllogisms** are common in daily conversations in which one person is trying to persuade another; polysyllogisms are also common in judicial opinions.

#### A Socrates Polysyllogism

Here is an [example ](#user-content-fn-9)[^9]of a polysyllogism based on the Socrates syllogism:

> **Rule:** All men are mortal.
>
> **Rule:** All mortals can die.
>
> **Rule:** People who can die are not gods.
>
> **Fact:** Socrates is a man.
>
> **Analysis to Conclusion:**
>
> * Because all men are mortal and Socrates is a man, Socrates is mortal.
> * Because Socrates is mortal and all mortals can die, Socrates can die.
> * Because people who can die are not gods and Socrates can die, Socrates is not a god.

Stemming from the three rules in the preceding example, the analysis could have also proceeded this way:

> * Because all men are mortals and mortals can die, all men can die.
> * Because people who can die are not gods and all men can die, men are not gods.
> * Because men are not gods and Socrates is a man, Socrates is not a god.

#### A Legal Polysyllogism

Here is a [legal example](#user-content-fn-10)[^10] of a polysyllogism:

> **Rule 1 (a "formula"):** Section 940.01 of the East Dakota statutes states, "Whoever is guilty of murder if they intentionally cause the death of another human being without a legal justification.
>
> **Rule 2 (a "formula"):** For murder, "intentional" means that the person acted with the purpose to cause the result.
>
> **Rule 3 (a "formula"):** The legal justification for murder is self-defense.
>
> **Fact 1 (a "variable"):** Henry is a human being.
>
> **Fact 2 (a "variable"):** Evidence[^11] from the investigation demonstrated that Jospeh shot and killed Henry inside Henry's home.
>
> **Fact 3 (a "variable"):** [Evidence ](#user-content-fn-11)[^11]from the investigation demonstrated that before killing Henry, Joseph broke into Henry's home, waited for Henry to return.
>
> **Fact 4 (a "variable"):** Evidence from the investigation demonstrated Joseph did not act in self-defense at the time he killed Henry.
>
> **Analysis:**
>
> * Joseph's act of shooting Henry, a human being, caused the death of another human being.
> * That Joseph laid in wait for Henry to return home is evidence that Joseph had the purpose to cause Henry's death.
> * Because Joseph had the purpose to cause Henry's death, he caused Henry's death intentionally.
> * Because Joseph did not act in self-defense when causing Henry's death, Joseph had no legal justification.
> * Therefore, Joseph is guilty of murder.

### Syllogisms (and Polysyllogisms) in Case Law

Common to judicial opinions, some arguments require [a little extra work to find the syllogism.](#user-content-fn-12)[^12] For example, based on the question of whether there is a [constitutional right to an abortion, in _Roe v. Wade_](#user-content-fn-13)[^13], the majority wrote:

> \[The] right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment’s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.

It may take some effort to extract the syllogism from this text because some premises are implicit, but this is the Court's argument:

> **Rule:** The Fourteenth Amendment provides for personal liberty and restrictions on state actions against a citizen, and the Ninth Amendment reserves rights \[not specifically enumerated in the first eight amendments] to the people.
>
> **Rule:** Either the Fourteenth \[as the Court's majority contends] or the Ninth Amendment, a right of privacy exists.
>
> **Rule:** If a state law criminalized someone for exercising their right of privacy, the law would be unconstitutional.
>
> **Rule:** The right of privacy includes a woman's decision whether to or not to terminate her pregnancy.
>
> **\[Facts from \_Roe v. Wade**\_\*\* not described above:\*\* In Texas, it was a crime to "procure an abortion." Roe was unable to find a doctor willing to perform an abortion (because the doctors did not want to be convicted of a crime). Roe claimed that the law banning abortion was unconstitutional.**]**
>
> **Analysis:**
>
> * By wishing to terminate her pregnancy, Roe was attempting to exercise her right of privacy.
> * The Texas law criminalized her attempt to exercise her right of privacy.
> * By criminalizing Roe's exercise of her right to privacy, the Texas law violated the Fourteenth and/or the Ninth Amendment.
>
> **Conclusion:** The Texas law was unconstitutional.

## Enthymemes

Also, many argument-based premises contain implicit or implied premises (propositions presumed to be true and not explicitly expressed by the arguer), which are called [**enthymemes**](#user-content-fn-14)[^14]. Generally, writers and speakers will use enthymemes for efficiency when they presume that the omitted premise is obvious[^15].

**Enthymemes** are also common in daily conversation and in [judicial opinions](#user-content-fn-15)[^15]. Here is an example[^16]:

> * Drunk driving hurts innocent people.
> * Therefore, drunk driving is wrong.

The syllogism has a missing link in the expressed chain of reasoning: Hurting innocent people is wrong\_.\_ The position that hurting innocent people is wrong is implied; its truth is simply presumed.

But enthymemes must be treated [with caution](#user-content-fn-15)[^15] because some people may use them as [hasty generalizations](#user-content-fn-17)[^17] or to hide a false premise that they imply is true. Hasty generalizations and false premises can lead to fundamentally flawed conclusions. For example[^16]:

Here is another example of an enthymeme:

> * Governor Johnson wants to reduce government regulation and oversight.
> * Therefore, Governor Johnson is an anarchist.

Here, the presumption is that a person who wants to reduce government regulation and oversight is an anarchist. Certainly, this presumption cannot be universally true. Thus, the result—Governor Johnson is an anarchist _because_ he wants to reduce regulation and oversight—is fundamentally flawed because of a hasty generalization (one of many [_**fallacies**_ ](#user-content-fn-18)[^18]that people make in arguments).

Now that we have taken a look at deductive or rule-based reasoning, we will move on to a type of inductive reasoning: [**analogical reasoning**](1.1.2-introduction-to-analogical-reasoning-a-type-of-inductive-reasoning.md).
